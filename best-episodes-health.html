<h1>12 Best Diary of a CEO Health Episodes — Sleep, Nutrition &amp; Longevity</h1>
<p class="intro">Steven Bartlett has interviewed the world's leading doctors, neuroscientists, and health experts. These 12 episodes will change how you sleep, eat, exercise, and think about your body — backed by science, not bro-science. Each one is worth 1.5 hours of your time (or 3 minutes with our summaries).</p>

<div class="ep-card" id="1"><div class="ep-rank">1</div>
<h3>Andrew Huberman — You Must Control Your Dopamine</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">Neuroscientist, Stanford Professor | Host of Huberman Lab</div>
<p>The most-watched DOAC episode for a reason. Huberman explains the dopamine system in a way that finally makes sense: why social media feels addictive, why motivation crashes after easy wins, and how to "reset" your dopamine baseline. This isn't self-help — it's neuroscience you can apply today.</p>
<blockquote>"If you want to maintain motivation, you must learn to attach the feeling of reward to effort itself, not the outcome."<cite>— Andrew Huberman, Stanford Neuroscientist</cite></blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Dopamine drops AFTER peaks. The higher the spike (drugs, social media, porn), the deeper the crash, the harder it is to find motivation for normal tasks. Fix: cold showers (2.5x dopamine for hours), delay gratification deliberately, limit phone use in the first hour after waking.</p>

<h3>Matthew Walker — The Sleep Expert</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">Professor of Neuroscience, UC Berkeley | Author of Why We Sleep</div>
<p>Walker makes a terrifying case: sleep deprivation is linked to cancer, Alzheimer's, heart disease, obesity, and depression — and most people are chronically under-sleeping without realizing it. He shares exactly how to optimize sleep using evidence-based protocols that cost nothing.</p>
<blockquote>"The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body health."<cite>— Matthew Walker, Author of Why We Sleep</cite></blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Non-negotiable sleep rules: (1) Same bed/wake time every day (yes, weekends), (2) Bedroom at 65°F/18°C, (3) No screens 1 hour before bed, (4) No caffeine after 2pm, (5) No alcohol — it fragments REM sleep. Even one night of 4-5 hours drops your immune function by 70%.</p>

<h3>Dr. Rangan Chatterjee — Stress Is Killing You Slowly</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">GP, Author of Feel Better in 5 | BBC Presenter</div>
<p>Dr. Chatterjee explains why 80% of GP visits are stress-related in disguise — back pain, digestive issues, fatigue, skin problems all trace back to chronic stress. He shares his "4 Pillar" framework for health that requires just 5 minutes per pillar per day.</p>
<blockquote>"You can't outrun a bad diet, but you also can't outsupplement a stressful life. Stress is the silent killer hiding behind every other diagnosis."<cite>— Dr. Rangan Chatterjee, Author of Feel Better in 5</cite></blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> The 4 Pillars: Relax (5 min meditation/breathing), Eat (5 min meal prep), Move (5 min movement), Sleep (5 min wind-down routine). Total: 20 min/day. Chatterjee's patients who followed this for 30 days showed measurable improvements in blood pressure, cortisol, and reported energy.</p>

<h3>Dr. Chris van Tulleken — Ultra-Processed Food Is Destroying You</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">Infectious Disease Doctor, BBC | Author of Ultra-Processed People</div>
<p>Van Tulleken went viral with his experiment: eating 80% ultra-processed food for a month, the way most people actually eat. Brain scans showed his brain physically rewired like an addiction. He breaks down what UPF actually is, why it's designed to be over-consumed, and the shocking industry tactics keeping you hooked.</p>
<blockquote>"Ultra-processed food is not food. It's an industrially produced edible substance designed to be over-consumed."<cite>— Dr. Chris van Tulleken, Author of Ultra-Processed People</cite></blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> If it has ingredients you wouldn't find in a home kitchen, it's UPF. After 4 weeks on UPF, van Tulleken's MRI showed new connections between his reward centers and the areas that drive automatic/compulsive behavior — the same pattern seen in addiction. The fix isn't willpower; it's replacing UPF with real food gradually.</p>

<h3>Dr. Mindy Pelz — The Fasting Expert</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">Functional Health Expert | Author of Fast Like a Girl</div>
<p>Dr. Pelz breaks down intermittent fasting beyond the basics: different fasting windows trigger different biological processes, and most people are doing it wrong. She shares her protocol for using fasting as a tool for autophagy (cellular cleanup), hormonal balance, and metabolic flexibility.</p>
<blockquote>"Fasting isn't about eating less. It's about giving your body time to repair. Every hour you're not eating, your cells are cleaning house."<cite>— Dr. Mindy Pelz, Author of Fast Like a Girl</cite></blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Fasting timeline: 12h = fat burning begins, 17h = autophagy (cell repair), 24h = gut reset, 36h = deep autophagy, 72h = immune system regeneration. For most people, 16:8 (eat in 8-hour window) is the sweet spot for daily benefits. Women need to cycle their fasting with their menstrual cycle.</p>

<h3>Andrew Huberman — Cold Showers, Light & Performance</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">Neuroscientist, Stanford Professor | Host of Huberman Lab</div>
<p>Huberman's second appearance dives into the science of cold exposure, morning light, and performance optimization. He explains exactly why a 2-minute cold shower produces a sustained dopamine increase equivalent to cocaine (without the crash), and how morning sunlight sets your circadian rhythm for better sleep, focus, and mood.</p>
<blockquote>"The most powerful performance tool on the planet is free. It's sunlight in your eyes within the first 30 minutes of waking."<cite>— Andrew Huberman, Stanford Neuroscientist</cite></blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Morning protocol: 10 min outdoor sunlight within 30 min of waking (no sunglasses) → 1-3 min cold shower (end cold) → delay caffeine 90 min after waking. This single stack optimizes cortisol timing, dopamine, and alertness better than any supplement or nootropic.</p>

<h3>Dr. Tim Spector — Your Gut Controls Everything</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">Professor of Genetic Epidemiology, King's College | Founder of ZOE</div>
<p>Spector makes the mind-blowing case that your gut microbiome controls far more than digestion — it affects your mood, weight, immune system, and even food cravings. The same meal can be healthy for one person and unhealthy for another based on their unique gut bacteria.</p>
<blockquote>"We are 50% human, 50% microbe. The idea that we can ignore the trillions of organisms living inside us and still be healthy is insane."<cite>— Dr. Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology</cite></blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Eat 30 different plants per week (not per day) — this is the single biggest predictor of gut health. Include fermented foods (kimchi, kefir, sauerkraut) daily. Avoid artificial sweeteners — they destroy beneficial gut bacteria. Your gut communicates with your brain via the vagus nerve; poor gut health = poor mental health.</p>

<h3>Wim Hof — The Iceman's Method</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">Extreme Athlete | Creator of the Wim Hof Method</div>
<p>The legendary "Iceman" explains the science behind his method: cold exposure + breathwork + commitment can directly influence the autonomic nervous system — something scientists previously thought was impossible. Hof demonstrates techniques live and shares how his method has helped people with autoimmune diseases, depression, and chronic inflammation.</p>
<blockquote>"The cold is your teacher. It demands your presence. You cannot be thinking about yesterday or tomorrow when ice water is on your skin."<cite>— Wim Hof, Creator of the Wim Hof Method</cite></blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> The Wim Hof Method: 30 deep breaths (in through nose, relaxed exhale) → hold on empty lungs → repeat 3 rounds → cold shower (start with 30 seconds, build to 2 min). Peer-reviewed studies show this method reduces inflammation markers, strengthens immune response, and elevates mood for hours.</p>

<h3>Dr. Paul Conti — The Hidden Epidemic of Trauma</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">Psychiatrist | Former Stanford, Harvard</div>
<p>Dr. Conti redefines trauma: it's not just PTSD from extreme events. Most people carry "little-t" trauma — chronic stress, emotional neglect, impossible standards — that silently drives anxiety, self-sabotage, and physical illness. He provides a clinical framework for identifying and processing trauma without years of therapy.</p>
<blockquote>"Trauma isn't what happened to you. Trauma is what happened INSIDE you as a result of what happened to you. That's what we can change."<cite>— Dr. Paul Conti, Psychiatrist</cite></blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Unprocessed trauma manifests physically: gut issues, chronic pain, autoimmune flares, insomnia. Conti's approach: (1) Map your "drives" — what motivates your behavior?, (2) Identify defensive structures you built to cope, (3) Ask: "Is this behavior serving who I am now, or who I was then?" Most anxiety is old trauma wearing a new mask.</p>

<h3>Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor — The 90-Second Emotion Rule</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">Neuroanatomist | TED Talk Legend (20M+ views)</div>
<p>The brain scientist who had a stroke and studied her own brain deteriorating in real-time shares her revolutionary insight: any emotion only lasts 90 seconds in the body. After that, you're choosing to re-stimulate it with your thoughts. This single insight has transformed how millions handle anger, anxiety, and sadness.</p>
<blockquote>"Within 90 seconds, an emotion will arise and wash through you. After that, if you're still feeling it, it's because you're choosing to think the thought that re-triggers it."<cite>— Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, Neuroanatomist</cite></blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> When a strong emotion hits, set a 90-second mental timer. Observe it in your body without attaching a story. After 90 seconds, the chemical cascade is complete. If the emotion continues, it's because you're feeding it with thoughts. This is neuroscience-backed emotional regulation that works immediately.</p>

<h3>Peter Attia — The Science of Living Longer</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">Physician | Author of Outlive | Longevity Expert</div>
<p>Attia introduces "Medicine 3.0" — proactive health optimization instead of waiting until you're sick. He shares the four pillars of longevity: exercise, nutrition, sleep, and emotional health — with specific metrics and protocols for each that go far beyond basic advice.</p>
<blockquote>"The leading cause of death is not heart disease or cancer. It's the decade of decline that precedes them. We need to train for the last decade of our lives."<cite>— Peter Attia, Author of Outlive</cite></blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Train for your "Centenarian Decathlon" — 10 physical tasks you want to do at age 90 (carry groceries, play with grandkids, climb stairs). Work backward from there. Current you needs: VO2 max training (zone 2 cardio 3x/week), strength training (4x/week), stability work, and regular blood biomarker tracking.</p>

<h3>Dr. Gabor Maté — The Body Keeps the Score</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">Physician, Addiction Expert | Author of The Myth of Normal</div>
<p>Dr. Maté draws the connection between childhood emotional patterns and adult physical disease. His thesis: the body stores what the mind suppresses, and chronic illness often has roots in emotional patterns formed before age 7. He shares why "positive thinking" alone fails and what actually works.</p>
<blockquote>"The question is not 'why the addiction?' but 'why the pain?' Every addiction is an attempt to solve a problem — usually a problem of emotional pain."<cite>— Dr. Gabor Maté, Author of The Myth of Normal</cite></blockquote>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, and digestive disorders correlate strongly with childhood emotional suppression. Maté's framework: people who learned to prioritize others' needs over their own feelings develop "physiological stress" that eventually manifests as disease. The treatment: learn to say no, feel your feelings, and stop being "nice" at the expense of being authentic.</p>
