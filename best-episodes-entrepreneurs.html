    <article class="episode-card" id="ep1">
        <h2><span class="episode-number">1</span> Simon Sinek: The Number One Reason Why You're Not Successful</h2>
        <p class="episode-meta">Guest: Simon Sinek — Author, Speaker, Leadership Expert</p>

        <p>Simon Sinek's appearance on DOAC is widely considered one of the most important episodes ever recorded. In a raw, 1.5-hour conversation with Steven Bartlett, Sinek breaks down why so many ambitious people fail — not because they lack talent, but because they misunderstand what leadership actually requires. He discusses infinite vs. finite games in business, the biology of trust, and why vulnerability is the most underrated entrepreneurial skill.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "The courage of leadership is not about being in charge. It's about taking care of those in your charge."
            <cite>— Simon Sinek, Author of <em>Start With Why</em></cite>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="why-it-matters">
            <strong>Why it matters for entrepreneurs:</strong> If you're building a team or struggling with the loneliness of leadership, this episode reframes everything. Sinek's framework for "just cause" gives you a north star that outlasts quarterly targets. This is the episode founders recommend most to first-time CEOs.
        </div>

        <div class="key-takeaways">
            <strong>Key Takeaways:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Business is an infinite game — stop playing it like a finite one</li>
                <li>Trust is biological: cortisol kills creativity, oxytocin enables it</li>
                <li>Your "why" needs to be bigger than your product</li>
            </ul>

    <!-- Episode 2 -->
    <article class="episode-card" id="ep2">
        <h2><span class="episode-number">2</span> Alex Hormozi: How to Build a $100M Business</h2>
        <p class="episode-meta">Guest: Alex Hormozi — Founder of Acquisition.com, Author of <em>$100M Offers</em></p>

        <p>Alex Hormozi doesn't deal in theory. In this no-nonsense episode, he lays out the exact frameworks he used to build a portfolio of companies generating over $200M in annual revenue. Hormozi covers how to craft irresistible offers, why most entrepreneurs undercharge, the math behind scaling, and the brutal truth about what it actually takes to win in business. Steven Bartlett called this one of the most tactical conversations he's ever had.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "You don't need more leads. You need a better offer. An offer so good people feel stupid saying no."
            <cite>— Alex Hormozi, Founder of Acquisition.com</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="why-it-matters">
            <strong>Why it matters for entrepreneurs:</strong> If you've ever struggled with pricing, sales, or getting customers to say yes — this episode is your masterclass. Hormozi's "value equation" alone is worth more than most MBA programs. Actionable from minute one.
        </div>

        <div class="key-takeaways">
            <strong>Key Takeaways:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The value equation: Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood ÷ Time × Effort</li>
                <li>Charge more, deliver more — the "race to the bottom" kills businesses</li>
                <li>Volume negates luck: do more, learn faster, win bigger</li>

    <!-- Episode 3 -->
    <article class="episode-card" id="ep3">
        <h2><span class="episode-number">3</span> Sara Blakely: The Billion Dollar Secret Behind Spanx</h2>
        <p class="episode-meta">Guest: Sara Blakely — Founder of Spanx, Self-Made Billionaire</p>

        <p>Sara Blakely went from selling fax machines door-to-door to becoming the world's youngest self-made female billionaire. In this deeply personal episode, she reveals the mindset shifts that made Spanx possible — including how her father's dinner-table question ("What did you fail at today?") rewired her relationship with failure. She shares the story of cold-calling Neiman Marcus, pitching in a bathroom stall, and protecting her idea for a year without a lawyer.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "My dad used to ask us every week, 'What did you fail at this week?' If we didn't have something, he'd be disappointed. He reframed failure as not trying."
            <cite>— Sara Blakely, Founder of Spanx</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="why-it-matters">
            <strong>Why it matters for entrepreneurs:</strong> Blakely's story demolishes every excuse. No connections, no fashion experience, no business degree. Just relentless execution and a willingness to look foolish. Essential listening for anyone who thinks they need permission to start.
        </div>

        <div class="key-takeaways">
            <strong>Key Takeaways:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Reframe failure as data — celebrate attempts, not just wins</li>
                <li>Naivety can be a superpower — she didn't know what was "impossible"</li>
                <li>Protect your idea energy: don't share too early with naysayers</li>

    <!-- Episode 4 -->
    <article class="episode-card" id="ep4">
        <h2><span class="episode-number">4</span> Naval Ravikant: How to Get Rich Without Getting Lucky</h2>
        <p class="episode-meta">Guest: Naval Ravikant — Angel Investor, Philosopher, Co-Founder of AngelList</p>

        <p>Naval Ravikant is Silicon Valley's philosopher-king, and his conversation with Steven goes far beyond typical startup advice. He explores the difference between wealth and status, why specific knowledge can't be taught, the importance of leverage (code, media, capital), and how to build judgment that compounds over decades. This episode distills years of Naval's famous tweetstorms into a coherent life philosophy for builders.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth."
            <cite>— Naval Ravikant, Co-Founder of AngelList</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="why-it-matters">
            <strong>Why it matters for entrepreneurs:</strong> Naval provides the philosophical foundation that most business advice lacks. Understanding leverage, specific knowledge, and accountability will change how you structure your entire career. This isn't a "hustle harder" episode — it's a "think clearer" episode.
        </div>

        <div class="key-takeaways">
            <strong>Key Takeaways:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage</li>
                <li>Code and media are permissionless leverage — use them</li>
                <li>Play long-term games with long-term people</li>
            </ul>

    <article class="episode-card" id="ep5">
        <h2><span class="episode-number">5</span> Gary Vaynerchuk: Why 99% of People Won't Build a Business</h2>
        <p class="episode-meta">Guest: Gary Vaynerchuk — CEO of VaynerMedia, Serial Entrepreneur</p>

        <p>Gary Vee brings his signature energy to this conversation about what actually separates builders from dreamers. He's refreshingly honest about the role of patience, the trap of comparing yourself to highlight reels, and why most aspiring entrepreneurs are addicted to the idea of entrepreneurship rather than the reality of it. The conversation turns deeply personal when Gary discusses his immigrant family's influence and his obsession with legacy over currency.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "You're not patient enough. That's the answer. Everyone wants to be an entrepreneur, but nobody wants to wait seven years with no results."
            <cite>— Gary Vaynerchuk, CEO of VaynerMedia</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="why-it-matters">
            <strong>Why it matters for entrepreneurs:</strong> A reality check wrapped in motivation. If you're two years into your business and feeling impatient, Gary's perspective on "macro patience, micro speed" is the recalibration you need. He makes a compelling case that kindness is the ultimate business strategy.
        </div>

        <div class="key-takeaways">
            <strong>Key Takeaways:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Macro patience, micro speed — move fast daily, expect results in years</li>
                <li>Self-awareness is the #1 entrepreneurial skill</li>
                <li>Stop consuming content about success; start producing work</li>

    <article class="episode-card" id="ep6">
        <h2><span class="episode-number">6</span> Dr. Julie Smith: The Psychology of Success and Self-Sabotage</h2>
        <p class="episode-meta">Guest: Dr. Julie Smith — Clinical Psychologist, Author of <em>Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?</em></p>

        <p>This episode tackles the inner game of entrepreneurship — the part nobody talks about on LinkedIn. Dr. Julie Smith explains the neuroscience behind procrastination, imposter syndrome, and why high-achievers often self-sabotage at the moment of breakthrough. She gives practical, science-backed tools for managing anxiety, building emotional resilience, and recognizing the cognitive distortions that keep entrepreneurs stuck.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Imposter syndrome isn't a sign that you're not ready. It's a sign that you're growing. The discomfort is the growth."
            <cite>— Dr. Julie Smith, Clinical Psychologist</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="why-it-matters">
            <strong>Why it matters for entrepreneurs:</strong> You can have the best strategy in the world, but if your psychology is working against you, you'll never execute. This episode gives you the mental toolkit that business schools ignore. Particularly powerful for founders dealing with burnout or anxiety.
        </div>

        <div class="key-takeaways">
            <strong>Key Takeaways:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Procrastination is an emotional regulation problem, not a time management one</li>
                <li>Name the emotion to tame it — labelling reduces amygdala activity</li>
                <li>Build "opposite action" habits: when fear says stop, that's often the signal to go</li>

    <!-- Episode 7 -->
    <article class="episode-card" id="ep7">
        <h2><span class="episode-number">7</span> Shaquille O'Neal: From Athlete to Business Empire</h2>
        <p class="episode-meta">Guest: Shaquille O'Neal — NBA Legend, Investor, Entrepreneur</p>

        <p>Most people know Shaq as one of the greatest basketball players ever. Fewer know he's a savvy businessman with investments in over 50 companies, including a stake in Google before its IPO. In this conversation, Shaq reveals how he nearly went broke early in his career, the financial education that saved him, and the business principles he learned from watching other athletes lose everything. His approach to brand partnerships and equity deals is a masterclass in leverage.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "I don't want to be rich. I want to be wealthy. Rich is temporary. Wealth is generational."
            <cite>— Shaquille O'Neal, NBA Legend &amp; Entrepreneur</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="why-it-matters">
            <strong>Why it matters for entrepreneurs:</strong> Shaq's transition from athlete to investor shows that business acumen can be learned at any stage. His "investor mindset" framework — where he evaluates every opportunity by asking "does this serve my community?" — is a refreshing antidote to pure profit-seeking. Proves that personal brand is the ultimate business moat.
        </div>

        <div class="key-takeaways">
            <strong>Key Takeaways:</strong>
            <ul>

                <li>Your name is your brand — protect it above all else</li>

        <p class="episode-meta">Guest: Trinny Woodall — Founder of Trinny London, TV Presenter</p>

        <p>Trinny Woodall's story is one of the most compelling comeback narratives on the podcast. After losing her husband, battling addiction, and facing financial ruin, she built Trinny London into a beauty brand valued at over £250 million. She discusses starting a business in her 50s, the power of direct-to-consumer models, how she used social media authentically before it was trendy, and why her worst moments became her greatest competitive advantage.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "My pain became my product. Everything I went through gave me an authenticity that no marketing budget could buy."

        </blockquote>

        <div class="why-it-matters">
            <strong>Why it matters for entrepreneurs:</strong> Destroys the myth that entrepreneurship has an age limit.

        <h2><span class="episode-number">9</span> Chris Williamson: The Uncomfortable Truth About Modern Success</h2>
        <p class="episode-meta">Guest: Chris Williamson — Podcaster, Entrepreneur, Author</p>

        <p>Chris Williamson's conversation with Steven is a deep dive into the hidden costs of ambition. They discuss the loneliness epidemic among entrepreneurs, why success often amplifies existing insecurities rather than solving them, and the importance of building a life you don't need to escape from. Chris brings research from evolutionary psychology and modern behavioral science to challenge the "grind at all costs" narrative that dominates entrepreneurial culture.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Most people are running toward success to escape something they haven't dealt with. The faster you run, the more it catches up."
            <cite>— Chris Williamson, Podcaster &amp; Author</cite>

            <strong>Why it matters for entrepreneurs:</strong> A crucial counterbalance to hustle culture. If you're successful but unfulfilled — or chasing goals that won't actually make you happy — this episode forces an honest reckoning. Williamson and Bartlett's chemistry makes this feel like eavesdropping on a conversation between two friends who refuse to lie to each other.

        <h2><span class="episode-number">10</span> Daniel Priestley: How to Become a Key Person of Influence</h2>
        <p class="episode-meta">Guest: Daniel Priestley — Serial Entrepreneur, Author of <em>Key Person of Influence</em></p>

        <p>Daniel Priestley's episode is arguably the most tactical on this list. He lays out a five-step framework for becoming the go-to authority in any industry: perfect your pitch, publish your ideas, build a product ecosystem, develop your profile, and create strategic partnerships. He explains why most businesses fail not because of a bad product, but because the founder is invisible. His concept of "campfire marketing" — where you gather an audience before you sell — is brilliant in its simplicity.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "In the age of information, the person who can articulate ideas clearly wins. Not the person with the best product — the person with the best pitch."
            <cite>— Daniel Priestley, Author of <em>Key Person of Influence</em></cite>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="why-it-matters">
            <strong>Why it matters for entrepreneurs:</strong> If you're building a business but nobody knows who you are, you have a distribution problem. Priestley's framework is the fastest path from unknown to authority. Especially powerful for service-based entrepreneurs, consultants, and personal brands.
