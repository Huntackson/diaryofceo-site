<h2>Who Is Steven Bartlett?</h2>

<p>For those new to the Diary of a CEO world, here's the quick version. Steven Bartlett was born in Botswana, grew up in Plymouth, England, and dropped out of Manchester Metropolitan University at age 18 with about £50 to his name. He slept on office floors, ate from vending machines, and built Social Chain — a social media marketing company — into a business that went public on the London Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>He became the youngest-ever Dragon on BBC's <em>Dragons' Den</em> at age 28. His podcast, <em>Diary of a CEO</em>, became the UK's #1 podcast and one of the top business shows globally. His book, <em>The Diary of a CEO: The 33 Laws of Business and Life</em>, became a Sunday Times bestseller.</p>

<p>In short: when Bartlett talks about money, business, and success, he's speaking from deep experience — both from his own journey and from interviewing hundreds of the world's top performers.</p>

<h2>💰 Steven Bartlett's Best Advice on Money</h2>

<div class="advice-card">
<span class="section-label">MONEY RULE #1</span>
<h3>Your Relationship With Money Is Inherited — Rewrite It</h3>
<p>Bartlett frequently discusses how our relationship with money is formed in childhood. Growing up in a household that struggled financially, he absorbed beliefs about money being scarce and hard to earn. On multiple DOAC episodes, he's shared how he had to consciously reprogram these beliefs to build wealth.</p>
<p>His advice: examine the money stories you inherited from your parents. Do you believe "money is the root of all evil"? That "rich people are greedy"? That "you have to work hard for every penny"? These unconscious beliefs act as a thermostat — they'll always bring you back to the level you subconsciously believe you deserve.</p>
<blockquote>"The money you earn will never exceed the money you believe you deserve. Fix the belief first."<cite>— Steven Bartlett</cite></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="advice-card">
<span class="section-label">MONEY RULE #2</span>
<h3>Invest in Skills Before Stocks</h3>
<p>While many personal finance influencers push index funds and compound interest (which Bartlett also endorses), his primary money advice for people under 30 is different: invest in yourself first. Learn high-value skills. Build a personal brand. Increase your earning capacity.</p>
<p>Bartlett argues that the ROI on a £500 course that helps you earn £50K more per year vastly outperforms any stock market return. His personal example: the hours he spent learning social media marketing as a teenager generated returns that no investment portfolio could match.</p>
<blockquote>"The best investment you'll ever make is in your own skills and knowledge. No market crash can take that away from you."<cite>— Steven Bartlett</cite></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="advice-card">
<span class="section-label">MONEY RULE #3</span>
<h3>Cash Flow Is King — Not Revenue, Not Valuation</h3>
<p>From his experience building Social Chain, Bartlett learned a painful lesson: revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, but cash flow is reality. He's shared stories of months where Social Chain had millions in revenue but was days away from running out of cash because of payment terms and overhead.</p>
<p>His advice to entrepreneurs: obsess over cash flow. Know your burn rate. Understand your payment cycles. A profitable business on paper can still die if it runs out of cash. This is the #1 lesson most first-time founders learn too late.</p>
<blockquote>"Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, but cash is king. You don't go bankrupt because you're unprofitable — you go bankrupt because you run out of cash."<cite>— Steven Bartlett</cite></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="advice-card">
<span class="section-label">MONEY RULE #4</span>
<h3>Lifestyle Inflation Is the Silent Wealth Killer</h3>
<p>Despite becoming a millionaire in his twenties, Bartlett has spoken about deliberately keeping his lifestyle below his means for years. He watched peers who earned similar money end up broke because they upgraded everything — cars, houses, watches — the moment their income increased.</p>
<p>His formula is simple: when your income doubles, don't let your lifestyle more than 50% increase. The gap between what you earn and what you spend is what builds real wealth. This isn't about deprivation — it's about delayed gratification with a purpose.</p>

<h2>🏗️ Steven Bartlett's Best Advice on Business</h2>

<div class="advice-card">
<span class="section-label">BUSINESS LESSON #1</span>
<h3>Start Before You're Ready</h3>
<p>Bartlett started Social Chain with no business plan, no investor deck, and no experience running a company. He was 18, broke, and had no idea what he was doing. He credits this naivety as an advantage — he didn't know enough to be scared.</p>
<p>His advice: stop waiting for the perfect moment, the perfect idea, or the perfect amount of savings. The learning happens in the doing. Every successful entrepreneur he's interviewed on DOAC started messy, started scared, and figured it out along the way.</p>
<blockquote>"If you wait until you're ready, you'll wait forever. The best entrepreneurs I know started before they had any right to."<cite>— Steven Bartlett</cite></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="advice-card">
<span class="section-label">BUSINESS LESSON #2</span>
<h3>Hire Slowly, Fire Quickly</h3>
<p>One of Bartlett's most repeated pieces of business advice — and one he learned the hard way. In Social Chain's early days, he hired fast to fill gaps, often bringing on people who weren't the right cultural fit. The result: internal drama, misalignment, and expensive mistakes.</p>
<p>He now advocates for a rigorous hiring process: multiple interviews, trial projects, reference checks, and a strong emphasis on values alignment. And when someone isn't working out? Act fast. Every week you keep the wrong person costs the business far more than the awkwardness of letting them go.</p>
</div>

<div class="advice-card">
<span class="section-label">BUSINESS LESSON #3</span>
<h3>Your First Customers Are Your Most Important</h3>
<p>Bartlett often talks about the mistake of chasing scale before nailing the fundamentals. He advises new entrepreneurs to obsess over their first 10, 50, 100 customers. Call them. Meet them. Understand their problems deeply. These early customers will tell you everything you need to know about your product, your positioning, and your market.</p>
<p>The businesses that scale fastest are the ones that served their first customers so well that word of mouth became their primary growth engine. Bartlett calls this "earning the right to scale."</p>
<blockquote>"Don't try to serve a million people. Try to make 10 people so happy they can't stop talking about you. Scale comes after."<cite>— Steven Bartlett</cite></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="advice-card">
<span class="section-label">BUSINESS LESSON #4</span>
<h3>The Unsexy Stuff Is What Actually Matters</h3>
<p>In a world of viral growth hacks and "one weird trick" business advice, Bartlett consistently champions the boring fundamentals: unit economics, cash management, operations, systems. He's seen too many startups fail because founders chased exciting features while ignoring whether their business model actually worked.</p>
<p>His advice: before you worry about marketing, partnerships, or product launches, make sure your numbers work. Can you acquire a customer for less than they're worth? Do you have positive unit economics? Is your business model fundamentally sound? If not, no amount of clever marketing will save you.</p>

<h2>🏆 Steven Bartlett's Best Advice on Success</h2>

<div class="advice-card">
<span class="section-label">SUCCESS PRINCIPLE #1</span>
<h3>Redefine What Success Means to You</h3>
<p>Bartlett has been refreshingly honest about the emptiness that followed his early business success. After Social Chain went public, he expected to feel fulfilled. Instead, he felt hollow. The goalpost had moved, and he realized he'd been chasing someone else's definition of success.</p>
<p>His evolved view: success isn't a destination. It's a daily practice of living according to your values. He now defines success as the combination of meaningful work, strong relationships, good health, and continuous growth. Money is a tool, not a scoreboard.</p>
<blockquote>"I achieved everything I thought would make me happy and felt nothing. That's when I realized I was chasing the wrong definition of success."<cite>— Steven Bartlett</cite></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="advice-card">
<span class="section-label">SUCCESS PRINCIPLE #2</span>
<h3>Your Network Is Your Net Worth (But Not How You Think)</h3>
<p>Bartlett doesn't mean this in the "go to networking events and collect business cards" sense. He means that the five people you spend the most time with shape your standards, your ambitions, and your beliefs about what's possible. Upgrading your peer group is the single fastest way to upgrade your results.</p>
<p>He advises finding communities — online or offline — of people 2-3 steps ahead of where you want to be. Not 100 steps ahead (they can't relate to your problems) but close enough that their success feels achievable and their habits are observable.</p>
</div>

<div class="advice-card">
<span class="section-label">SUCCESS PRINCIPLE #3</span>
<h3>Discipline > Motivation</h3>
<p>One of Bartlett's most viral clips comes from his take on motivation vs. discipline. Motivation is fleeting — it comes and goes with your mood, your sleep, and what you had for breakfast. Discipline is showing up every day regardless of how you feel.</p>
<p>He shares that during Social Chain's toughest years, he rarely felt motivated. What kept him going was a system of non-negotiable daily actions: making calls, reviewing metrics, creating content, and showing up for his team. The motivation came later, after the results started showing.</p>
<blockquote>"Motivation gets you started. Discipline keeps you going. And the people who win are the ones who show up on the days they don't feel like it."<cite>— Steven Bartlett</cite></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="advice-card">
<span class="section-label">SUCCESS PRINCIPLE #4</span>
<h3>Failure Is Data, Not an Ending</h3>
<p>Bartlett's journey is littered with failures: product launches that flopped, hires that went wrong, campaigns that bombed, a relationship with money that nearly broke him. But he frames each failure as a data point — information about what doesn't work, which narrows the path to what does.</p>
<p>He often references the Sara Blakely dinner table story (which he heard on his own podcast) about being asked "What did you fail at today?" His version: keep a "failure resume" — a document of every major failure and what you learned from it. Over time, it becomes your most valuable strategic asset.</p>

<div id="mindset">
<h2>🧠 On Mindset & Mental Toughness</h2>

<div class="advice-card">
<h3>Protect Your Mental Health Like a Business Asset</h3>
<p>Bartlett is one of the few high-profile entrepreneurs who talks openly about mental health struggles. He's discussed anxiety, loneliness, and the toll that building a business took on his wellbeing. His key message: your mental health isn't separate from your business — it IS your business. A burned-out founder makes bad decisions, hires poorly, and eventually ruins what they've built.</p>
<p>He advocates for therapy, journaling, exercise, and setting boundaries as non-negotiable business practices. Not self-care as a luxury — self-care as a strategic imperative.</p>
</div>

<div class="advice-card">
<h3>Question Every Belief You Hold</h3>
<p>Through hundreds of DOAC conversations, Bartlett has developed what he calls "aggressive open-mindedness." He actively seeks out perspectives that challenge his own beliefs, knowing that the biggest breakthroughs come from changing your mind, not confirming what you already think.</p>
<p>His advice: once a quarter, identify your three strongest beliefs about business and actively try to disprove them. Read the opposing argument. Talk to people who disagree. The beliefs that survive this process are worth keeping. The ones that don't were holding you back.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="marketing">
<h2>📢 On Marketing & Personal Brand</h2>

<div class="advice-card">
<h3>Content Is the New Business Card</h3>
<p>Bartlett built Social Chain on the back of social media content, and he built DOAC into a media empire through consistent, high-quality content creation. His advice for entrepreneurs: your content IS your marketing. Every piece of content you create is working for you 24/7, building trust and authority while you sleep.</p>
<p>He recommends starting with one platform, mastering it, then expanding. His personal journey went from Twitter threads → Instagram → YouTube (DOAC) → TikTok. Each platform was added only after the previous one was producing consistent results.</p>
<blockquote>"In the modern world, if you're not creating content, you're invisible. And invisible businesses die."<cite>— Steven Bartlett</cite></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="advice-card">
<h3>Tell Stories, Not Features</h3>
<p>From his early days at Social Chain, Bartlett learned that people don't share facts — they share stories. The businesses that grow fastest are the ones that tell the most compelling stories. Not about their product, but about the transformation their product creates.</p>
<p>His framework: every piece of marketing should answer "How does this make someone's life better?" If you can't answer that clearly and emotionally, you're not ready to market yet.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="people">
<h2>👥 On People & Leadership</h2>

<div class="advice-card">
<h3>Lead With Vulnerability</h3>
<p>Bartlett's leadership style has evolved dramatically from his early days. He went from trying to project confidence and strength at all times to embracing vulnerability as a leadership tool. Sharing his doubts, mistakes, and struggles with his team didn't make him look weak — it made his team trust him more.</p>
<p>This is a through-line in many DOAC episodes: the guests who've built the strongest teams are the ones who lead with honesty, not bravado. People don't follow perfect leaders — they follow real ones.</p>
<blockquote>"The moment I stopped pretending to have all the answers was the moment my team started giving me better ones."<cite>— Steven Bartlett</cite></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="advice-card">
<h3>Build a Culture That Attracts A-Players</h3>
<p>After struggling with hiring early on, Bartlett developed a philosophy around culture-first leadership. His advice: define your company's values (real ones, not poster ones), live them visibly, and hire exclusively for cultural alignment. Skills can be taught; values can't.</p>
<p>He points to DOAC's own team as an example: everyone who works on the podcast shares a genuine obsession with learning, growth, and storytelling. The result is a team that doesn't need micromanaging because they're intrinsically motivated by the mission.</p>

<h2>How to Apply Steven Bartlett's Advice</h2>

<p>Reading advice is easy. Implementing it is hard. Here's a practical framework for actually using these insights:</p>

<p><strong>Pick one lesson per week.</strong> Don't try to overhaul your entire approach to money, business, and success simultaneously. Choose the single piece of advice most relevant to your current situation and focus on it for seven days.</p>

<p><strong>Listen to the source episodes.</strong> This article distills Bartlett's wisdom, but hearing him explain these concepts in context — with real examples and emotional depth — is far more powerful. Browse our <a href="/episodes">full episode guide</a> or check the <a href="/best-episodes.html">best episodes</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>Journal on it.</strong> Bartlett himself is a prolific journaler. After absorbing a piece of advice, write about how it applies to your specific situation. What would change if you actually followed this advice? What's stopping you?</p>

<p><strong>Find accountability.</strong> Share what you're implementing with a friend, mentor, or online community. Bartlett consistently emphasizes that success is not a solo sport.</p>

<p><strong>Read the book.</strong> <em>The Diary of a CEO: The 33 Laws of Business and Life</em> compiles Bartlett's most important lessons into a structured framework. If this article resonated, the book goes 10X deeper.</p>
