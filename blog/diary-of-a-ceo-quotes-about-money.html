        <h2 style="display:block; border:none; font-size:1.3rem; margin-bottom:16px;">Why These Diary of a CEO Quotes About Money Matter</h2>
        <p>
            What makes these <strong>Diary of a CEO quotes about money</strong> so impactful isn't just the words — it's the context. Every one of these guests has been in the trenches. They've been broke, made millions, lost it all, and rebuilt. When Alex Hormozi talks about solving problems for money, he's speaking from the experience of building a $100M+ portfolio. When Sara Blakely talks about starting with $5,000, she became the youngest self-made female billionaire in America.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:16px;">
            Steven Bartlett's genius as a host is pulling these raw, unfiltered truths out of his guests. The Diary of a CEO isn't a surface-level interview show — it's a masterclass in how the world's most successful people actually think about money, risk, and wealth creation.
