    <div class="container">
        <p class="intro">
            Diary of a CEO isn't just the UK's biggest podcast — it's a masterclass in conversation. Steven Bartlett consistently extracts insights that guests say they've never shared anywhere else. After breaking down <a href="https://diaryofceo.online">178+ episodes</a>, the patterns in his <strong>interview technique</strong> become clear. Whether you're a podcaster, journalist, manager, or just someone who wants better conversations, these 10 <strong>Steven Bartlett interview tips</strong> are immediately usable.
        </p>

        <h2>Preparation Techniques</h2>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="number">Tip 01</div>
            <h3>Research the Person, Not Just Their Work</h3>
            <p>Most interviewers read the guest's Wikipedia page and latest press release. Bartlett goes deeper — childhood stories, old interviews, throwaway comments on other podcasts. He finds the thread they haven't fully explored and pulls on it. The result: guests feel genuinely understood, which makes them open up.</p>
            <div class="example"><strong>In practice:</strong> Before interviewing a CEO, don't just read about their company. Find out what they were doing at 15. That's where the real story lives.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="number">Tip 02</div>
            <h3>Prepare Questions, Then Abandon Them</h3>
            <p>Bartlett has said he prepares extensively but rarely follows his question list. The preparation gives him confidence and context; the conversation gives him direction. This is the key difference between an interview and a conversation — following curiosity in real-time rather than ticking through a checklist.</p>
            <div class="example"><strong>In practice:</strong> Write 30 questions. Bring them. Then listen so intently that you ask the 31st question — the one that only exists because of what the guest just said.</div>
        </div>

        <h2>Questioning Techniques</h2>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="number">Tip 03</div>
            <h3>Use Silence as a Tool</h3>
            <p>When a guest finishes an answer, most interviewers immediately jump to the next question. Bartlett often pauses. Just two or three seconds of silence. It's uncomfortable — and that discomfort is productive. The guest almost always continues, going deeper than their rehearsed answer. The best moments on DOAC often come after these silences.</p>
            <div class="example"><strong>In practice:</strong> After someone answers, count to three in your head before speaking. What they say in those three seconds is usually more honest than everything before it.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="number">Tip 04</div>
            <h3>Ask "Why" Like a Five-Year-Old</h3>
            <p>Bartlett isn't afraid to ask the obvious follow-up. "Why?" And then again: "But why do you think that is?" Most adults stop asking "why" because they're afraid of looking unintelligent. Bartlett uses it as a scalpel — cutting through rehearsed surface answers to find the real belief underneath.</p>
            <div class="example"><strong>In practice:</strong> Guest says "I wake up at 5am." You ask "Why?" They say "discipline." You ask "Why is discipline important to you specifically?" Now you're getting somewhere.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="number">Tip 05</div>
            <h3>Make Statements, Not Just Questions</h3>
            <p>One of Bartlett's signature moves is making a bold statement and watching the guest react. Instead of "Do you think money changes people?", he'll say "I think money doesn't change people — it just reveals who they already were." This forces the guest to either agree and expand, or disagree and explain. Either way, you get a more interesting answer.</p>
            <div class="example"><strong>In practice:</strong> Turn your question into a thesis. Let the guest be the expert who confirms, challenges, or nuances your position.</div>
        </div>

        <blockquote>
            "The best conversations happen when both people are genuinely trying to figure something out — not when one person is performing."
            <span class="attr">— Steven Bartlett, Host of Diary of a CEO</span>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="number">Tip 06</div>
            <h3>Be Vulnerable First</h3>
            <p>Bartlett frequently shares his own struggles — with mental health, with his parents' divorce, with loneliness at the top. This isn't self-indulgent; it's strategic. When the interviewer is vulnerable first, it gives the guest permission to match that vulnerability. The emotional depth of DOAC episodes is a direct result of this reciprocity.</p>
            <div class="example"><strong>In practice:</strong> Before asking someone about failure, share one of your own. Vulnerability is contagious.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="number">Tip 07</div>
            <h3>Read the Energy, Not Just the Words</h3>
            <p>When a guest's voice drops, when they look away, when they pause mid-sentence — Bartlett notices. He'll gently say "I can see that still affects you" or simply wait. This emotional attunement is what separates a good interviewer from a great one. The words are 30% of the conversation; the energy is 70%.</p>
            <div class="example"><strong>In practice:</strong> Watch the body, not just the mouth. When someone shifts physically, there's something underneath that's worth exploring.</div>
        </div>

        <h2>Structural Techniques</h2>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="number">Tip 08</div>
            <h3>Start With Story, Not Credentials</h3>
            <p>Bartlett rarely opens with "So tell us about your company." Instead, he might open with "Take me back to the moment you realized everything was about to change." This immediately establishes the episode as narrative-driven rather than promotional. The guest becomes a character in a story, not a spokesperson for a brand.</p>
            <div class="example"><strong>In practice:</strong> Your first question should make someone feel, not think. "What was the worst moment?" beats "What does your company do?" every time.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="number">Tip 09</div>
            <h3>Use the "Last Guest" Bridge</h3>
            <p>Bartlett often references something a previous guest said to create contrast or build on an idea. "The last person who sat in that chair told me X — do you agree?" This does three things: it makes the guest feel part of something bigger, creates intellectual tension, and gives the audience continuity between episodes.</p>
            <div class="example"><strong>In practice:</strong> Reference a contrasting viewpoint from someone the guest respects. Intellectual friction produces the best content.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="number">Tip 10</div>
            <h3>End With the Question They Didn't Expect</h3>
            <p>Bartlett's closing questions often catch guests off-guard. Instead of "Any final thoughts?", he'll ask something deeply personal or philosophical. "What do you want your children to know that you never told them?" These unexpected endings create the viral clips that rack up millions of views on YouTube.</p>
            <div class="example"><strong>In practice:</strong> Save your most personal, unexpected question for the last five minutes — when the guest's guard is completely down.</div>
        </div>

        <h2>Why These Tips Work Beyond Podcasting</h2>
        <p>These aren't just interview techniques — they're conversation techniques. The same principles apply in job interviews, sales calls, first dates, and difficult conversations with family members. The core insight across all of them: <strong>people open up when they feel safe, understood, and genuinely listened to.</strong></p>
        <p>That's free. It doesn't require equipment or training. It just requires caring more about the answer than your next question.</p>
