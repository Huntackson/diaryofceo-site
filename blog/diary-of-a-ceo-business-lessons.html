        <p class="section-label">Lessons 1–6</p>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">1</span>
            <h3>Start Before You're Ready</h3>
            <p>Every successful founder on DOAC shares this: they started with imperfect products, incomplete knowledge, and overwhelming doubt. Steven Bartlett dropped out of university with no business plan. Sara Blakely started Spanx with $5,000 and zero fashion experience. The common thread? Action preceded clarity.</p>
            <blockquote>"I had no idea what I was doing. And that was actually my biggest advantage — I wasn't limited by how things had always been done."<cite>— Sara Blakely, Founder of Spanx</cite></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Apply it:</strong> Stop waiting for the perfect moment, the perfect plan, or the perfect product. Launch with 80% readiness and iterate. The market teaches faster than any business plan.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">2</span>
            <h3>Solve a Problem You Personally Have</h3>
            <p>The businesses that succeed at the highest rate are the ones solving a real problem the founder personally experiences. Bartlett emphasizes this repeatedly — he built Social Chain because he understood social media from the inside as a digital native. Alex Hormozi built Gym Launch because he'd struggled running his own gyms.</p>
            <p><strong>Apply it:</strong> Write down the 10 biggest frustrations in your daily life. At least one of them is a business idea. Your lived experience is your unfair advantage — you already understand the customer because you <em>are</em> the customer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">3</span>
            <h3>Your First Business Won't Be Your Best</h3>
            <p>Almost no one's first business is their biggest success. Steven had multiple ventures before Diary of a CEO became a global phenomenon. The point of your first business is to learn the meta-skills: selling, hiring, managing cash flow, handling stress. Those skills compound into everything you do after.</p>
            <blockquote>"Your first business is tuition. You're paying to learn. The degree you get is the skills, the network, and the pattern recognition that make your next ventures successful."<cite>— Steven Bartlett, Host of Diary of a CEO</cite></blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">4</span>
            <h3>Pick a Market, Not Just a Product</h3>
            <p>Alex Hormozi's biggest lesson from DOAC: the market you choose matters more than the product you build. A great product in a dying market will fail. A mediocre product in a growing market with desperate buyers will succeed. Choose starving crowds.</p>
            <p><strong>Apply it:</strong> Before building anything, ask: Are people actively spending money to solve this problem? Is the market growing? Can I reach these people? If any answer is no, keep looking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">5</span>
            <h3>Protect Your Idea in the Early Stages</h3>
            <p>Sara Blakely told no one about Spanx for an entire year. Not friends, not family. Her reasoning? New ideas are fragile. Other people's doubts — even well-meaning ones — can extinguish the spark before it catches fire. Only share when you have momentum.</p>
            <p><strong>Apply it:</strong> In the first 90 days of a new project, limit your inner circle to 2-3 people who are genuinely supportive. Everyone else gets told after you've shipped.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">6</span>
            <h3>The "Do Things That Don't Scale" Principle</h3>
            <p>Multiple DOAC guests echo Paul Graham's famous advice. In the beginning, do the unscalable things: personally onboard every customer, hand-write thank you notes, deliver the product yourself. These actions build deep customer understanding that no amount of data analytics can replace.</p>
            <p><strong>Apply it:</strong> Whatever you're building, personally talk to your first 50 customers. Not surveys — conversations. The insights will reshape your entire business.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="growth">Growth & Scaling</h2>
        <p class="section-label">Lessons 7–12</p>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">7</span>
            <h3>Make Your Offer So Good People Feel Stupid Saying No</h3>
            <p>Alex Hormozi's "Grand Slam Offer" concept has become one of the most-referenced DOAC episodes. The framework: stack so much value into your offer — guarantees, bonuses, speed, convenience — that the perceived value is 10x the price. When the offer is irresistible, you don't need aggressive sales tactics.</p>
            <blockquote>"If you're having trouble selling, it's not a sales problem — it's an offer problem. Fix the offer and the sales take care of themselves."<cite>— Alex Hormozi, CEO of Acquisition.com</cite></blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">8</span>
            <h3>Revenue Is Vanity, Profit Is Sanity, Cash Is Reality</h3>
            <p>Multiple guests have hammered this point. Revenue means nothing if your margins are thin and your cash flow is negative. Too many founders chase topline growth while bleeding money. The businesses that survive are the ones that respect cash flow above all.</p>
            <p><strong>Apply it:</strong> Track three numbers weekly: revenue, profit margin, and days of cash runway. If your runway drops below 90 days, stop all non-essential spending immediately.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">9</span>
            <h3>Your Existing Customers Are Your Best Growth Channel</h3>
            <p>Hormozi's insight: most businesses spend 80% of their energy on acquisition and 20% on retention. Flip it. A customer who stays for 3 years is worth 10x a new customer. Referrals from happy customers convert at 3-5x the rate of cold traffic. The cheapest, most effective marketing is making your current customers love you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">10</span>
            <h3>Content Is the New Cold Call</h3>
            <p>Steven Bartlett built a media empire on this principle: if you consistently create valuable content, you never need to cold-pitch anyone. Customers come to you. Partners approach you. Opportunities find you. Content is leverage that compounds over time — a podcast episode from 2020 still generates leads in 2026.</p>
            <p><strong>Apply it:</strong> Pick one platform. Post daily for 90 days. Share genuine insights from your work. By day 90, you'll have more inbound opportunities than you can handle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">11</span>
            <h3>Speed Wins</h3>
            <p>Daniel Priestley's appearance on DOAC crystalized this: in business, speed of implementation is more important than perfection. The company that ships fast, learns fast, and iterates fast will outpace the competitor with the better strategy but slower execution.</p>
            <blockquote>"The speed at which you implement an idea is more important than the quality of the idea. A good idea executed quickly beats a perfect idea executed slowly — every single time."<cite>— Daniel Priestley, Author & Entrepreneur</cite></blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">12</span>
            <h3>Know When to Pivot vs. When to Persist</h3>
            <p>One of the hardest decisions in business. Steven's framework: if the <em>market</em> is responding (people want what you're selling) but execution is hard, persist. If the market is indifferent despite your best efforts, pivot. Market pull is the signal. Internal conviction without external validation is delusion.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="leadership">Leadership & People</h2>
        <p class="section-label">Lessons 13–17</p>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">13</span>
            <h3>Hire Slow, Fire Fast</h3>
            <p>Every founder who's scaled past 50 employees shares this regret: they didn't fire underperformers fast enough. Simon Sinek's framing: keeping a toxic high-performer destroys culture faster than any external threat. Culture is built by who you keep, not by what you put on the wall.</p>
            <p><strong>Apply it:</strong> The person you've been thinking about firing for months? You already know the answer. Have the conversation this week.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">14</span>
            <h3>Leadership Is Making People Feel Safe</h3>
            <p>Simon Sinek's DOAC episode remains one of the most-viewed: great leadership isn't about charisma or strategy. It's about creating an environment where people feel safe enough to take risks, admit mistakes, and bring their full capability to work. Psychological safety is the #1 predictor of team performance.</p>
            <blockquote>"Leadership is not about being in charge. It is about taking care of those in your charge."<cite>— Simon Sinek, Author & Speaker</cite></blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">15</span>
            <h3>Build the Team You Need Next Year, Not This Year</h3>
            <p>One of Steven's personal lessons from scaling Social Chain: the team that got you to £1M revenue can't get you to £10M. And the team at £10M can't get you to £100M. At each stage, you need different people with different skills. The hardest part is outgrowing people you care about.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">16</span>
            <h3>Radical Candor Over Comfortable Silence</h3>
            <p>Brené Brown's message to leaders: avoiding difficult conversations isn't being kind — it's being selfish. Clear feedback, delivered with empathy and respect, is the greatest gift you can give someone. The alternative — letting problems fester — always ends worse for everyone.</p>
            <p><strong>Apply it:</strong> Use the SBI framework: Situation ("In yesterday's meeting..."), Behavior ("When you interrupted the client..."), Impact ("It undermined our credibility"). Factual, specific, focused on behavior rather than character.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">17</span>
            <h3>Your Company Culture Is What You Tolerate</h3>
            <p>Not what's on your careers page. Not your company values poster. Culture is defined by the worst behavior you're willing to accept. If someone consistently shows up late and nothing happens, punctuality isn't your culture. If someone takes credit for others' work and gets promoted, integrity isn't your culture.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="money-strategy">Money & Strategy</h2>
        <p class="section-label">Lessons 18–21</p>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">18</span>
            <h3>Wealth Is What You Don't Spend</h3>
            <p>Morgan Housel's DOAC episode reshaped how many listeners think about money. The visible signs of wealth — cars, watches, mansions — often indicate the <em>absence</em> of actual wealth. Real wealth is invisible: it's the investments, the savings, the options. Building wealth requires spending less than you earn, consistently, for a long time.</p>
            <blockquote>"The only way to build wealth is to have a gap between your ego and your income."<cite>— Morgan Housel, Author of The Psychology of Money</cite></blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">19</span>
            <h3>Invest in Yourself Before Any Asset Class</h3>
            <p>Steven's most passionate point about money: the highest-returning investment is always yourself. A $500 course that teaches you a skill, a $50 book that shifts your thinking, a $200/month gym membership that gives you energy — these compound in ways that no stock portfolio can match in the early stages of your career.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">20</span>
            <h3>Price on Value, Not on Cost</h3>
            <p>Hormozi's pricing lesson: most businesses charge based on what it costs them to deliver, plus a margin. Wrong. Price based on the value of the outcome you create. If your consulting saves a client £500K, charging £50K isn't expensive — it's a 10x return. Frame your price as an investment, not a cost.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">21</span>
            <h3>Diversify Your Revenue, Not Just Your Investments</h3>
            <p>A recurring DOAC theme: the most resilient businesses and individuals have multiple revenue streams. Steven himself has income from the podcast, investments (Dragon's Den), his company Flight Story, speaking, and more. No single source could tank him. Build the same resilience into your financial life.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="mindset">Mindset & Resilience</h2>
        <p class="section-label">Lessons 22–25</p>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">22</span>
            <h3>Reframe Failure as Data</h3>
            <p>Sara Blakely's father asked her every night: "What did you fail at today?" If she hadn't failed at anything, he was disappointed. This reframe — failure as evidence of trying, not evidence of inadequacy — is the single most common trait among DOAC's most successful guests.</p>
            <p><strong>Apply it:</strong> At the end of each week, write down your three biggest failures. Next to each one, write what you learned. Over time, this practice eliminates the fear of failure entirely.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">23</span>
            <h3>Your Environment Determines Your Ceiling</h3>
            <p>You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. This isn't a cliché on DOAC — it's a diagnostic tool. If your five closest people aren't growing, learning, and pushing themselves, your own growth has a ceiling. Upgrading your environment is the highest-leverage change you can make.</p>
            <blockquote>"Show me your friends and I'll show you your future. Your network isn't your net worth — it's your thermostat. It determines the temperature of your ambition."<cite>— Steven Bartlett, Host of Diary of a CEO</cite></blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">24</span>
            <h3>Discipline Beats Motivation Every Time</h3>
            <p>Motivation is a feeling. It comes and goes. Discipline is a practice — showing up on the days you don't feel like it. Every world-class performer on DOAC, from athletes to CEOs, has said the same thing: the gap between good and great isn't talent. It's consistency when motivation disappears.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson">
            <span class="lesson-num">25</span>
            <h3>The Question That Changes Everything</h3>
            <p>Steven ends every DOAC episode with the same question: "What's the last thing the previous guest told you to ask me?" This creates a chain of wisdom between guests, and it reveals a meta-lesson: the best questions come from unexpected sources. In your own business, the most valuable insights often come from outside your industry.</p>
            <p><strong>Apply it:</strong> Once a month, have a deep conversation with someone completely outside your field. A teacher, a chef, an athlete. Cross-pollination of ideas is where breakthroughs live.</p>
