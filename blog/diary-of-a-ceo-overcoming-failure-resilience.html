        <h1>Diary of a CEO: The Best Advice on Overcoming Failure & Building Unshakeable Resilience</h1>
        <p class="meta">Updated February 2026 · 11 min read</p>

        <p>Failure is the one topic that every Diary of a CEO guest has in common. Behind every success story Steven Bartlett has explored on the podcast lies a chapter of crushing defeat, rejection, or near-collapse that the guest had to survive before they could thrive. These aren't motivational platitudes — they're raw, detailed accounts of what rock bottom actually looks like and, more importantly, how to climb back up.</p>

        <p>This guide collects the <strong>most powerful failure stories and resilience advice from Diary of a CEO episodes</strong>, organized into practical frameworks you can use when life knocks you down.</p>

        <h2>Steven Bartlett's Own Failure Story: The Foundation of DOAC</h2>

        <p>Before exploring guests' stories, it's worth understanding that the entire Diary of a CEO podcast was born from failure and struggle. Steven Bartlett has shared his origin story across multiple episodes, and it's far from the glamorous "young entrepreneur builds empire" narrative people assume.</p>

        <p>Bartlett grew up in a low-income household in Plymouth. He dropped out of university after attending a single lecture because he felt the education system wasn't designed for someone like him. He then moved to Manchester with almost nothing, sleeping on friends' floors and running a series of failed ventures before eventually building Social Chain.</p>

        <p>But even Social Chain's early days were marked by failure. Bartlett has spoken about periods where he couldn't afford to pay himself, where client deals fell through at the last minute, and where the stress led to anxiety and depression that he hid from everyone around him.</p>

        <blockquote>"I've failed so many times that failure doesn't scare me anymore. It's familiar. And that familiarity is a superpower because it means I'll try things that other people won't." — Steven Bartlett</blockquote>

        <h3>What Bartlett Learned from His Failures</h3>

        <p>Across his conversations with guests, Bartlett has distilled his failure philosophy into several core principles:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speed of recovery matters more than avoidance of failure.</strong> You can't prevent setbacks, but you can get faster at recovering from them. Bartlett calls this "bounce-back speed" and considers it the most underrated entrepreneurial skill.</li>
            <li><strong>The stories you tell yourself about failure determine everything.</strong> The same event — a business going under, a relationship ending, a rejection letter — can be either a defining defeat or a redirecting moment. The only difference is the narrative you attach to it.</li>
            <li><strong>Share your failures publicly.</strong> Bartlett credits being open about his struggles as one of the things that built his audience. Vulnerability isn't weakness — it's the fastest way to build genuine connection with others.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Alex Hormozi: From $100M Failure Lessons to $100M Offers</h2>

        <p>Alex Hormozi's appearance on The Diary of a CEO was one of the podcast's most-watched business episodes, and for good reason. Hormozi, now worth over $100 million, was brutally honest about the failures that preceded his success.</p>

        <h3>The Gym Launch Near-Death Experience</h3>

        <p>Hormozi shared the story of his first major business — a chain of gyms — that nearly destroyed him financially. He had six gym locations that were all losing money simultaneously. He was hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, sleeping on the floor of one of his gyms because he couldn't afford rent, and his relationship was under enormous strain.</p>

        <p>The turning point came when he was forced to close five of the six locations and focus everything on making one work. This painful consolidation taught him a lesson he's repeated many times since: <strong>focus is saying no to things that are working, not just things that aren't.</strong></p>

        <div class="story-box">
            <h4>📖 The $400K Lesson</h4>
            <p>Hormozi told Steven about a deal where he invested $400,000 into a business partnership that completely fell apart. He lost the entire amount. Rather than dwelling on it, he asked himself one question: "What did I learn that's worth $400,000?" His answer: he learned to never enter a partnership without clear, written agreements about roles, equity, and exit terms. He said that single lesson has saved him millions since.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Hormozi's Framework for Processing Failure</h3>

        <p>Hormozi shared a specific mental framework he uses whenever something goes wrong:</p>

        <ol class="number-list">
            <li><strong>Accept it happened.</strong> Don't deny, minimise, or blame. Just acknowledge reality as it is. "This happened. It's real. Now what?"</li>
            <li><strong>Extract the lesson immediately.</strong> While the pain is fresh, write down what you learned. If you wait, you'll forget the nuance and only remember the emotion.</li>
            <li><strong>Calculate the real cost.</strong> Most failures feel catastrophic in the moment but are recoverable. Ask yourself: "Will this matter in 10 years?" If not, the appropriate emotional response is probably closer to mild annoyance than devastation.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the next move within 24 hours.</strong> Hormozi said the biggest trap after failure is paralysis. He forces himself to take at least one forward-moving action within 24 hours of any setback — even if it's small.</li>
        </ol>

        <blockquote>"The people who win aren't the ones who don't fail. They're the ones who fail and keep going. That's it. That's the entire secret." — Alex Hormozi on The Diary of a CEO</blockquote>

        <h2>Sara Davies: Rejection, Dragons' Den, and Building a Multi-Million Pound Business</h2>

        <p>Sara Davies, who went from appearing on Dragons' Den as an entrepreneur to sitting in the chair as a Dragon, shared a powerful failure story during her DOAC episode. Before her company Crafter's Companion became a massive success, she faced years of rejection.</p>

        <p>Davies talked about pitching her product to major retailers and being told repeatedly that nobody would buy it. She recalled one meeting where a buyer literally laughed at her product concept. Rather than being defeated, she used each rejection to refine her pitch and improve her product.</p>

        <p>Her advice on DOAC was refreshingly practical: <strong>"Keep a rejection file."</strong> She literally kept a folder of every rejection email and letter she received. When she eventually succeeded, she'd look through it — not to gloat, but to remind herself that the people who rejected her weren't being malicious. They simply couldn't see what she could see. And that's often what entrepreneurship requires: maintaining belief in something that nobody else believes in yet.</p>

        <h2>Dr. Julie Smith: The Psychology of Resilience</h2>

        <p>Dr. Julie Smith, the clinical psychologist and author who has amassed millions of followers through her mental health content, brought a clinical perspective to failure and resilience on The Diary of a CEO. Her advice was less about business failure and more about the psychological architecture that determines whether failure breaks you or builds you.</p>

        <h3>The Difference Between Resilient and Non-Resilient People</h3>

        <p>Dr. Smith explained that resilience isn't a personality trait you either have or don't. It's a set of skills that can be developed. She identified several key differences between people who bounce back from adversity and those who don't:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resilient people feel the pain fully.</strong> Counterintuitively, they don't suppress negative emotions. They allow themselves to feel disappointed, angry, or sad — but they don't let those feelings become their identity. They say "I feel devastated" not "I am a devastated person."</li>
            <li><strong>They have a "growth mindset" about setbacks.</strong> They genuinely believe they can learn and adapt, rather than seeing failure as evidence of a fixed, unchangeable limitation.</li>
            <li><strong>They maintain social connections.</strong> The single biggest predictor of resilience, according to Dr. Smith, is having at least one person you can be honest with about your struggles. Isolation is the enemy of resilience.</li>
            <li><strong>They take action, even imperfect action.</strong> When things go wrong, resilient people do something — anything — that gives them a sense of agency. This could be as simple as going for a walk, making a plan, or calling a friend.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>💡 Dr. Smith's "Opposite Action" Technique</h4>
            <p>When you're in a failure spiral, your instinct is to withdraw, isolate, and stop trying. Dr. Smith recommended doing the <em>opposite</em> of what your emotions are telling you. If you want to stay in bed, get up. If you want to cancel plans, go anyway. If you want to give up on a project, do five minutes of work on it. This doesn't ignore your feelings — it prevents them from dictating your behaviour.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Mo Gawdat: Redefining Failure Through the Lens of Grief</h2>

        <p>Mo Gawdat, the former Chief Business Officer of Google X, brought perhaps the most profound perspective on failure to DOAC. After the devastating loss of his son Ali during a routine surgery, Gawdat rebuilt his entire understanding of suffering, happiness, and what "failure" truly means.</p>

        <p>His core message on DOAC was that most of what we call "failure" in business and life is trivially small compared to what humans are actually capable of enduring. This isn't said to minimise anyone's pain — it's said to remind us that we are far more resilient than we believe.</p>

        <p>Gawdat shared his "happiness equation" from his book <em>Solve for Happy</em>: happiness equals or exceeds your perception of events minus your expectations of how life should be. Failure only hurts to the extent that reality falls short of your expectations. Adjust your expectations — not to be pessimistic, but to be realistic — and failure loses most of its sting.</p>

        <blockquote>"Every failure is just an event. You add the suffering by comparing it to what you think should have happened. Remove the comparison and you remove most of the pain." — Mo Gawdat on The Diary of a CEO</blockquote>

        <h2>Practical Resilience: A Framework from DOAC Episodes</h2>

        <p>Synthesizing the advice from dozens of DOAC guests, here's a practical framework for building resilience and overcoming failure:</p>

        <h3>Phase 1: The First 24 Hours After Failure</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Allow yourself to feel it.</strong> Don't immediately jump to "positive vibes only." Sit with the disappointment. As Dr. Julie Smith said, suppressed emotions don't go away — they come back stronger.</li>
            <li><strong>Tell one person.</strong> Call a friend, partner, or mentor and be honest about what happened. Breaking the isolation immediately reduces the emotional weight.</li>
            <li><strong>Write it down.</strong> Journal what happened factually, what you're feeling emotionally, and what you think went wrong. This externalizes the experience and prevents rumination.</li>
            <li><strong>Take one small action.</strong> Follow Hormozi's rule: do one thing that moves you forward, no matter how small.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phase 2: The First Week</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Extract lessons formally.</strong> Write a "post-mortem" as if you were analysing someone else's failure. What were the decision points? What would you do differently? This is Hormozi's practice of making failure "worth the tuition."</li>
            <li><strong>Reframe the narrative.</strong> Bartlett's advice: consciously choose the story you tell about what happened. Not a delusional spin — but a story that includes growth, learning, and forward momentum.</li>
            <li><strong>Protect your basics.</strong> Sleep, nutrition, movement. Every DOAC guest agrees: when life falls apart, protecting these three fundamentals gives you the physical and mental foundation to rebuild.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phase 3: Moving Forward</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Set a small, achievable goal.</strong> After a major failure, your confidence is shattered. Rebuild it with small wins. Don't try to launch the next big thing immediately — just complete something, anything, successfully.</li>
            <li><strong>Study other failure stories.</strong> This is literally what DOAC does best. Hearing how others survived similar or worse situations normalizes your experience and provides practical strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Use the failure as fuel, not baggage.</strong> Multiple DOAC guests have described a moment where their anger or frustration at failing became motivating rather than paralysing. Hormozi described it as "I'll show them" energy — not spite, but determination.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The DOAC Episodes to Watch When You're Going Through It</h2>

        <p>If you're currently dealing with failure or a major setback, these specific DOAC episodes are the most useful, ranked by situation:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Business failure or financial loss:</strong> Watch the Alex Hormozi episode. His specificity about dollar amounts lost and strategies used to recover makes it immediately actionable.</li>
            <li><strong>Rejection or self-doubt:</strong> Watch the Sara Davies episode and the Steven Bartlett solo episodes where he discusses imposter syndrome. Both normalize rejection as part of the process.</li>
            <li><strong>Existential crisis or questioning everything:</strong> Watch the Mo Gawdat episode. His philosophical framework for suffering and happiness will fundamentally shift your perspective.</li>
            <li><strong>Mental health struggle:</strong> Watch Dr. Julie Smith's episode. Her clinical expertise provides tools, not just inspiration.</li>
            <li><strong>General motivation and "getting back on the horse":</strong> Watch any episode featuring someone who started from nothing — Bartlett's own story, or guests like Gary Vaynerchuk who combine raw energy with practical advice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The One Thing Every DOAC Guest Agrees On</h2>

        <p>After hundreds of episodes and conversations with people from every walk of life — billionaires, athletes, scientists, artists, survivors — there's one insight about failure that comes up universally on The Diary of a CEO:</p>

        <p><strong>The failure itself is never the problem. The story you tell yourself about the failure is the problem.</strong></p>

        <p>Every single guest who has overcome significant adversity describes a moment where they consciously chose to interpret their failure differently. Not denial — but reframing. Seeing it as data, as education, as redirection, as motivation. The failure stays the same; the meaning changes. And when the meaning changes, everything changes.</p>

        <p>That's not motivational fluff. It's the lived experience of people who have lost millions, faced public humiliation, experienced devastating personal losses, and come back stronger. If they can do it, so can you. And listening to their stories on DOAC is one of the best places to start.</p>
