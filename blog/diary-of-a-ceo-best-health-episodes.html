    <h2 id="sleep-energy">🛏 Sleep & Energy Episodes</h2>
    <p>Sleep is the foundation of health, and Steven Bartlett has hosted two of the world's foremost sleep experts. These episodes have collectively racked up tens of millions of views.</p>

    <div class="episode-card">
        <h3>1. Dr. Matthew Walker — "Sleep Is Your Superpower"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: Dr. Matthew Walker, Professor of Neuroscience at UC Berkeley, Author of <em>Why We Sleep</em></p>
        <div><span class="tag">Sleep</span><span class="tag">Neuroscience</span><span class="tag">Performance</span></div>
        <p>This is the episode that made millions of people rethink their relationship with sleep. Dr. Walker explains how sleeping less than 7 hours literally shrinks your brain, weakens your immune system, and makes you more likely to develop Alzheimer's. He breaks down the exact mechanisms of REM and deep sleep, why alcohol is one of the worst things for sleep quality, and shares his non-negotiable sleep protocol.</p>
        <blockquote>"The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. It's as simple as that."<cite>— Dr. Matthew Walker</cite></blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> Keep your bedroom at 18°C (65°F), avoid caffeine after noon, maintain a consistent wake time even on weekends, and never hit the snooze button.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="episode-card">
        <h3>2. Dr. Andrew Huberman — "The Science of Sleep, Dopamine & Motivation"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: Dr. Andrew Huberman, Professor of Neurobiology at Stanford University</p>
        <div><span class="tag">Neuroscience</span><span class="tag">Dopamine</span><span class="tag">Sleep</span><span class="tag">Motivation</span></div>
        <p>Huberman's appearance on DOAC is one of the most information-dense podcast episodes ever recorded. Over the course of the conversation, he covers the neuroscience of dopamine (and why your phone is hijacking it), how morning sunlight exposure sets your circadian rhythm, the science behind cold exposure, and practical protocols for focus and energy.</p>
        <blockquote>"Get sunlight in your eyes within the first 30 to 60 minutes of waking. This single behaviour will improve your sleep, your mood, and your focus more than almost anything else."<cite>— Dr. Andrew Huberman</cite></blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> 10 minutes of morning sunlight exposure, delay caffeine 90-120 minutes after waking, use the "physiological sigh" (double inhale through nose, long exhale through mouth) for instant stress relief.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="episode-card">
        <h3>3. Gary Brecka — "The Gene Testing Doctor Who Transformed Bartlett's Health"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: Gary Brecka, Human Biologist and Bio-Hacker</p>
        <div><span class="tag">Biohacking</span><span class="tag">Supplements</span><span class="tag">Energy</span></div>
        <p>This is the episode Steven Bartlett himself calls life-changing. Gary Brecka runs through genetic testing, MTHFR gene mutations (which affect how your body processes vitamins), and the supplement stack that transformed Bartlett's energy. The conversation covers methylated B vitamins, the importance of oxygen, and why many people are unknowingly deficient in key nutrients.</p>
        <blockquote>"You don't have a disease. You have a deficiency. Fix the deficiency, and the disease goes away."<cite>— Gary Brecka</cite></blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> Get your genes tested, consider methylated B vitamins (especially if you're always tired), practice breathwork daily, and hydrogen-rich water may improve energy levels.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 id="nutrition-gut">🥗 Nutrition & Gut Health Episodes</h2>
    <p>Some of the most viral DOAC episodes are about food — specifically, what the food industry doesn't want you to know. These episodes will fundamentally change how you eat.</p>

    <div class="episode-card">
        <h3>4. Dr. Chris van Tulleken — "Ultra-Processed Food Is Destroying Your Body"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: Dr. Chris van Tulleken, Infectious Disease Doctor, BBC Presenter, Author of <em>Ultra-Processed People</em></p>
        <div><span class="tag">Nutrition</span><span class="tag">Ultra-Processed Food</span><span class="tag">Food Industry</span></div>
        <p>This episode has over 20 million views for a reason. Dr. van Tulleken conducted a self-experiment where he ate 80% ultra-processed food for a month — and the results were terrifying. His brain scans showed addiction-like changes, he gained weight rapidly, and his mood deteriorated. He explains how to identify ultra-processed food (the "would your grandmother recognise every ingredient?" test) and why the food industry engineers products to be addictive.</p>
        <blockquote>"Ultra-processed food is not food that's been processed. It's an industrially produced edible substance."<cite>— Dr. Chris van Tulleken</cite></blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> If a product has an ingredient your grandmother wouldn't recognise, it's ultra-processed. Cook from scratch when possible. Read ingredient lists, not nutrition labels.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="episode-card">
        <h3>5. Dr. Tim Spector — "The Shocking Truth About Your Food"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: Dr. Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King's College London, Founder of ZOE</p>
        <div><span class="tag">Gut Health</span><span class="tag">Microbiome</span><span class="tag">Nutrition</span></div>
        <p>Dr. Spector's research on the gut microbiome has transformed how we think about food. In this episode, he reveals why calorie counting is largely useless (because everyone's body processes food differently), why gut health is the single biggest predictor of overall health, and why you should aim to eat 30 different plants per week. He also debunks common nutrition myths — including the idea that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.</p>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> Eat 30 different plants per week (herbs and spices count), fermented foods are a gut health superpower, your gut microbiome is unique — what works for someone else might not work for you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="episode-card">
        <h3>6. Dr. Will Bulsiewicz — "Your Gut Is Your Second Brain"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: Dr. Will Bulsiewicz, Gastroenterologist, Author of <em>Fiber Fueled</em></p>
        <div><span class="tag">Gut Health</span><span class="tag">Fiber</span><span class="tag">Digestion</span></div>
        <p>Dr. B (as he's known online) takes a deep dive into the gut-brain connection, explaining how your gut microbiome directly affects your mood, immune system, and even your weight. He makes a compelling case for fibre as the single most important nutrient most people aren't getting enough of, and shares practical tips for improving gut health without expensive supplements.</p>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> Aim for 30g+ fibre daily, diversity of plant foods matters more than volume, most gut health supplements are a waste of money — focus on real food instead.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="fitness-body">💪 Fitness & Body Optimization Episodes</h2>
    <p>Whether you want to build muscle, lose fat, or simply move better, these episodes deliver science-backed fitness advice from world-class experts.</p>

    <div class="episode-card">
        <h3>7. Dr. Layne Norton — "The Fitness Expert Who Debunks Everything"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: Dr. Layne Norton, PhD in Nutritional Sciences, Powerlifting Champion</p>
        <div><span class="tag">Fitness</span><span class="tag">Muscle Building</span><span class="tag">Fat Loss</span></div>
        <p>Layne Norton is a myth-destroying machine. In this episode, he dismantles popular fitness claims: intermittent fasting isn't magic (it just helps some people eat less), there's no "anabolic window" where you must eat protein immediately after training, and cardio doesn't "kill your gains." He provides evidence-based guidance on protein intake (1.6-2.2g per kg of bodyweight), training frequency, and why consistency beats any hack.</p>
        <blockquote>"The best diet is the one you can stick to. The best training programme is the one you'll actually do."<cite>— Dr. Layne Norton</cite></blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> Protein is king for body composition (aim for ~2g per kg bodyweight), progressive overload is the only way to build muscle, and sustainability matters more than optimisation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="episode-card">
        <h3>8. Wim Hof — "The Iceman's Guide to Controlling Your Mind & Body"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: Wim Hof, Extreme Athlete, Creator of the Wim Hof Method</p>
        <div><span class="tag">Cold Exposure</span><span class="tag">Breathwork</span><span class="tag">Mindset</span></div>
        <p>The legendary Iceman sits down with Steven for one of the most intense DOAC conversations ever. Wim Hof explains the science behind cold exposure — how it boosts norepinephrine by 200-300%, reduces inflammation, and strengthens the immune system. He guides through his breathing technique live on camera, and shares the deeply personal story of how he developed his method after his wife's death.</p>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> Cold showers (end with 30-60 seconds of cold) can transform your energy and mood, breathwork is free medicine, start gradually and build tolerance over time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="episode-card">
        <h3>9. James Smith — "The No-BS Personal Trainer"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: James Smith, Personal Trainer and Author of <em>Not a Diet Book</em></p>
        <div><span class="tag">Fat Loss</span><span class="tag">Fitness</span><span class="tag">No BS</span></div>
        <p>James Smith cuts through the noise of the fitness industry with brutal honesty. He explains why most people fail at fat loss (they overcomplicate it), why NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) — basically daily walking — matters more than your gym sessions for weight loss, and why the fitness industry profits from your confusion. A refreshingly honest conversation.</p>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> Walk 8,000-10,000 steps daily (this matters more than gym workouts for fat loss), calorie deficit is the only way to lose fat, and stop following fitness influencers who sell you complexity.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="longevity">⏳ Longevity & Anti-Aging Episodes</h2>
    <p>How do you live longer, healthier, and with more vitality? These episodes tackle the science of ageing and what you can do about it right now.</p>

    <div class="episode-card">
        <h3>10. Dr. Rangan Chatterjee — "The 4 Pillar Plan for a Longer, Healthier Life"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: Dr. Rangan Chatterjee, GP, Author of <em>Feel Better in 5</em> and <em>The 4 Pillar Plan</em></p>
        <div><span class="tag">Longevity</span><span class="tag">Lifestyle Medicine</span><span class="tag">Stress</span></div>
        <p>Dr. Chatterjee has appeared on DOAC multiple times, and each conversation is packed with practical wisdom. His 4 Pillar approach — food, movement, sleep, and relaxation — offers a simple framework for total health. He argues that 80% of chronic diseases are preventable through lifestyle changes, and that most people don't need more information — they need fewer, simpler actions they'll actually stick to.</p>
        <blockquote>"Health is not about perfection. It's about making small, sustainable changes that compound over time."<cite>— Dr. Rangan Chatterjee</cite></blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> Five minutes of movement every morning, one meal per day without screens, a "strength" conversation with someone you love daily, and 15 minutes of stillness or journaling.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="episode-card">
        <h3>11. Dr. Peter Attia — "The Science of Living Longer"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: Dr. Peter Attia, Longevity Expert, Author of <em>Outlive</em></p>
        <div><span class="tag">Longevity</span><span class="tag">Exercise</span><span class="tag">Disease Prevention</span></div>
        <p>Dr. Attia reframes longevity as "Medicine 3.0" — a proactive approach to preventing the four horsemen of chronic disease: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and metabolic dysfunction. He emphasises that exercise is the most powerful longevity drug we have, and breaks down exactly what kind of exercise matters most: VO2 max training (zone 2 cardio and high-intensity work) and maintaining muscle mass through resistance training.</p>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> Zone 2 cardio (3-4 hours per week where you can barely hold a conversation), strength training to maintain muscle as you age, and get your metabolic health markers tested (ApoB, fasting insulin, glucose).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="episode-card">
        <h3>12. Bryan Johnson — "The Man Spending Millions to Reverse His Age"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: Bryan Johnson, Entrepreneur and Founder of Blueprint Protocol</p>
        <div><span class="tag">Anti-Aging</span><span class="tag">Biohacking</span><span class="tag">Longevity</span></div>
        <p>Whether you think Bryan Johnson is a visionary or extreme, this episode is fascinating. Johnson spends over $2 million per year on his anti-ageing protocol, takes 100+ supplements daily, and has a team of 30+ doctors monitoring every organ in his body. He shares his results (his biological age has measurably decreased), his daily routine (he goes to bed at 8:30 PM every night), and his philosophy that humans should hand over health decisions to data and algorithms.</p>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> You don't need millions — the basics (sleep, exercise, nutrition) account for 80% of results. Track your biomarkers. And sunscreen is one of the most underrated anti-ageing tools.</p>

    <h2 id="mental-health">🧠 Mental Health Episodes</h2>
    <p>Physical health is only half the picture. These episodes address anxiety, depression, trauma, and the psychology of wellbeing.</p>

    <div class="episode-card">
        <h3>13. Dr. Gabor Maté — "The Root Cause of Every Addiction & Disease"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: Dr. Gabor Maté, Physician and Author of <em>The Myth of Normal</em></p>
        <div><span class="tag">Trauma</span><span class="tag">Addiction</span><span class="tag">Mental Health</span></div>
        <p>Dr. Maté's DOAC appearance is emotionally profound. He connects childhood trauma to adult disease, explaining how unresolved emotional pain manifests as physical illness, addiction, and mental health disorders. He challenges the conventional medical model that separates mind from body, arguing that true healing requires addressing the whole person — not just their symptoms.</p>
        <blockquote>"The question is not 'why the addiction?' The question is 'why the pain?'"<cite>— Dr. Gabor Maté</cite></blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> Unresolved trauma lives in the body and drives disease, compassionate self-inquiry is more healing than willpower, and asking "what happened to you?" matters more than "what's wrong with you?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="episode-card">
        <h3>14. Dr. Julie Smith — "The Psychologist Fixing the Mental Health Crisis"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: Dr. Julie Smith, Clinical Psychologist, Author of <em>Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?</em></p>
        <div><span class="tag">Mental Health</span><span class="tag">Psychology</span><span class="tag">Anxiety</span></div>
        <p>Dr. Julie Smith brings clinical psychology out of the therapy room and into everyday conversation. She discusses the difference between normal emotional fluctuations and clinical depression, shares practical techniques for managing anxiety (including the "5-4-3-2-1" grounding technique), and explains why social media is particularly damaging to mental health. Her approach is accessible, evidence-based, and refreshingly non-judgmental.</p>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> Motivation follows action (not the other way around), small daily habits matter more than big breakthroughs, and journaling is one of the most evidence-backed mental health tools available.</p>

        <h3>15. Professor Steve Peters — "The Chimp Paradox"</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guest: Professor Steve Peters, Psychiatrist and Author of <em>The Chimp Paradox</em></p>
        <div><span class="tag">Psychology</span><span class="tag">Emotional Management</span><span class="tag">Performance</span></div>
        <p>Professor Peters' "Chimp Model" has been used by Olympic athletes, Premier League football teams, and corporate leaders. In this episode, he explains the two competing systems in your brain — the rational "Human" and the emotional "Chimp" — and provides a framework for managing impulsive emotions, making better decisions under stress, and building emotional resilience. Steven Bartlett has called this one of the most useful frameworks he's ever learned.</p>
        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong> Your emotional brain reacts 5x faster than your rational brain, you can't control your chimp but you can manage it, and acknowledging your emotions before trying to rationalise them is essential.</p>

    <h2 id="how-to-watch">📺 How to Watch & Key Patterns</h2>
    <p>After reviewing all 15 episodes, some clear patterns emerge about what the world's top health experts agree on:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sleep is non-negotiable.</strong> Every single health expert on DOAC emphasises sleep as the #1 health intervention. If you only change one thing, fix your sleep.</li>
        <li><strong>Walk more.</strong> From Dr. Chatterjee to James Smith to Dr. Attia — daily walking (8,000-10,000 steps) is the most underrated health habit.</li>
        <li><strong>Eat real food.</strong> Dr. van Tulleken, Dr. Spector, and Dr. Norton all agree: cut ultra-processed food and eat more plants.</li>
        <li><strong>Strength train.</strong> For longevity, maintaining muscle mass as you age is one of the strongest predictors of healthspan.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage stress.</strong> Chronic stress underlies nearly every disease. Breathwork, cold exposure, or simply walking in nature all help.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Recommended watching order for beginners:</strong> Start with Dr. Rangan Chatterjee (most accessible), then Dr. Matthew Walker (sleep foundation), then Dr. Chris van Tulleken (nutrition transformation), and build from there.</p>
