    <h2 id="business">📈 Business & Entrepreneurship</h2>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Business</span>
        <h3>1. <em>The Lean Startup</em> — Eric Ries</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Mentioned in multiple early episodes</p>
        <p>The book that shaped how Steven built Social Chain. Build, measure, learn. Don't spend years perfecting a product nobody wants — ship fast, get feedback, iterate. Steven has called this the most practical <a href="https://diaryofceo.online/seo-pages/diary-of-a-ceo-best-business-advice.html">business book</a> he's ever read.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Business</span>
        <h3>2. <em>Zero to One</em> — Peter Thiel</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Referenced in entrepreneurship conversations</p>
        <p>Thiel's contrarian thesis: the best businesses create something entirely new rather than competing in existing markets. Steven has quoted the core question repeatedly: "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Business</span>
        <h3>3. <em>Good to Great</em> — Jim Collins</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Discussed with business guests</p>
        <p>Collins studied why some companies make the leap to sustained greatness while others don't. The "flywheel" concept and "Level 5 Leadership" are ideas Steven has referenced when discussing what separates good founders from great ones.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Business</span>
        <h3>4. <em>Shoe Dog</em> — Phil Knight</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Steven's favourite founder memoir</p>
        <p>The Nike origin story. Raw, honest, and unglamorous. Steven loves this book because it shows entrepreneurship as it really is — messy, uncertain, and full of near-death moments. Required reading for anyone who romanticizes startups.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Business</span>
        <h3>5. <em>The Hard Thing About Hard Things</em> — Ben Horowitz</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Referenced in <a href="https://diaryofceo.online/seo-pages/best-diary-of-a-ceo-episodes-for-entrepreneurs.html">entrepreneur episodes</a></p>
        <p>No MBA teaches you how to fire your friend or manage a company on the edge of bankruptcy. Horowitz does. Steven has recommended this for anyone in the dark, lonely middle phase of building something.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Business</span>
        <h3>6. <em>Happy Sexy Millionaire</em> — Steven Bartlett</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Steven's own book</p>
        <p>Steven's memoir-meets-manifesto about the lies society sells about success. It's not strictly a business book — it challenges the assumption that money, status, and achievement will make you happy. A deeply personal read that sets up the philosophy behind the entire podcast.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Business</span>
        <h3>7. <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> — Daniel Kahneman</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Discussed with multiple guests</p>
        <p>Kahneman's masterwork on the two systems of thinking — the fast, intuitive one that's often wrong, and the slow, deliberate one that's hard to engage. Steven references this in conversations about decision-making, cognitive biases, and why smart people make dumb choices.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="psychology">🧠 Psychology & Mindset</h2>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Psychology</span>
        <h3>8. <em>Atomic Habits</em> — James Clear</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">One of the most-discussed books on the show</p>
        <p>The 1% improvement framework. Clear appeared on the podcast and broke down how tiny habit changes compound into massive results. The "habit stacking" and "environment design" concepts have been referenced in dozens of subsequent episodes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Psychology</span>
        <h3>9. <em>The Body Keeps the Score</em> — Bessel van der Kolk</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Referenced in trauma and mental health conversations</p>
        <p>How trauma lives in the body, not just the mind. This book comes up whenever guests discuss PTSD, childhood experiences, or why talk therapy alone sometimes isn't enough. Essential context for understanding the <a href="https://diaryofceo.online/seo-pages/diary-of-a-ceo-best-health-advice.html">health episodes</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Psychology</span>
        <h3>10. <em>Man's Search for Meaning</em> — Viktor Frankl</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">A recurring recommendation from guests</p>
        <p>Frankl's account of surviving Auschwitz and discovering that meaning — not pleasure — is what keeps people alive. Steven and several guests have called this the single most important book they've ever read. Short, devastating, and life-changing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Psychology</span>
        <h3>11. <em>The Power of Now</em> — Eckhart Tolle</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Mentioned in <a href="https://diaryofceo.online/seo-pages/best-episodes-mindset.html">mindset episodes</a></p>
        <p>Tolle's argument that most suffering comes from living in the past or future rather than the present. Multiple guests have credited this book with transforming their relationship to anxiety and overthinking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Psychology</span>
        <h3>12. <em>12 Rules for Life</em> — Jordan Peterson</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Discussed when Peterson appeared on the show</p>
        <p>Peterson's guide to finding order in chaos. "Clean your room" became a cultural meme, but the deeper ideas — about responsibility, meaning, and confronting suffering — resonated strongly with Steven's audience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Psychology</span>
        <h3>13. <em>The Chimp Paradox</em> — Prof Steve Peters</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">A UK favourite, discussed in several episodes</p>
        <p>Peters' model of the emotional brain (the "chimp") vs. the rational brain (the "human") and how to manage the conflict. Hugely popular with athletes and entrepreneurs — Steven has credited it with helping him manage emotional reactivity in business.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="health">🏥 Health & Science</h2>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Health</span>
        <h3>14. <em>Why We Sleep</em> — Matthew Walker</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Referenced in every sleep discussion</p>
        <p>Walker appeared on the podcast and made the case that sleep is the single most important thing you can do for your health. This book is a wake-up call (pun intended) — poor sleep is linked to cancer, Alzheimer's, heart disease, and obesity. After reading it, Steven overhauled his sleep routine.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Health</span>
        <h3>15. <em>Breath</em> — James Nestor</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Discussed in breathing and wellness episodes</p>
        <p>Nestor's investigation into how modern humans have forgotten how to breathe properly — and the extraordinary health benefits of relearning. Nasal breathing, slower breathing, and breath-hold exercises are all covered. Pairs perfectly with the Huberman and Wim Hof episodes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Health</span>
        <h3>16. <em>Outlive</em> — Dr. Peter Attia</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">A modern longevity bible</p>
        <p>Attia's framework for "Medicine 3.0" — proactive, personalized health optimization rather than waiting for disease. Covers exercise, nutrition, sleep, and emotional health as the four pillars of longevity. Frequently referenced in <a href="https://diaryofceo.online/seo-pages/diary-of-a-ceo-best-health-advice.html">health advice discussions</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Health</span>
        <h3>17. <em>The Glucose Revolution</em> — Jessie Inchauspé</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Discussed after Jessie's appearance on the show</p>
        <p>Simple hacks to flatten your glucose curves — eat fibre first, add vinegar, walk after meals. Inchauspé made blood sugar management accessible to non-diabetics and showed how glucose spikes drive cravings, fatigue, and weight gain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Health</span>
        <h3>18. <em>Food for Life</em> — Tim Spector</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Referenced in gut health conversations</p>
        <p>Spector's guide to eating for your microbiome. The "30 plants per week" rule, the case for fermented foods, and why calorie counting misses the point. A foundational text for anyone interested in the gut-health episodes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="relationships">❤️ Relationships & Communication</h2>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Relationships</span>
        <h3>19. <em>Mating in Captivity</em> — Esther Perel</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Discussed when Perel appeared on the show</p>
        <p>Perel's provocative thesis: love and desire are fundamentally different needs, and satisfying both in one relationship requires deliberate effort. The tension between security and mystery is at the heart of every long-term <a href="https://diaryofceo.online/seo-pages/diary-of-a-ceo-relationship-advice.html">relationship</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Relationships</span>
        <h3>20. <em>Attached</em> — Amir Levine & Rachel Heller</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Referenced in attachment style discussions</p>
        <p>The accessible guide to attachment theory in adult relationships. Helps you identify your style (anxious, avoidant, secure) and understand why certain relationship patterns keep repeating. Multiple guests have called it essential reading before dating seriously.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Relationships</span>
        <h3>21. <em>The 5 Love Languages</em> — Gary Chapman</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">A classic referenced across episodes</p>
        <p>Chapman's framework — words of affirmation, acts of service, receiving gifts, quality time, physical touch — helps partners understand that they may express and receive love differently. Simple but powerful, especially when couples feel disconnected despite both "trying."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book-card">
        <span class="book-category">Relationships</span>
        <h3>22. <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> — Dale Carnegie</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Steven's early influence</p>
        <p>The granddaddy of social skills books. Steven has mentioned reading this as a teenager and crediting it with shaping how he builds relationships in business. The principles — genuine interest, listening, making people feel important — are timeless.</p>
    </div>
