<h2>Why Entrepreneurs Love Diary of a CEO</h2>

<p>Unlike most business podcasts that skim the surface with motivational platitudes, Diary of a CEO digs deep into the mechanics of building businesses. Steven Bartlett — who built and sold Social Chain for over £200 million before age 30 — asks the questions that founders actually care about. How did you get your first customers? What nearly killed the business? What would you do differently?</p>

<p>The result is a library of entrepreneurial education that rivals any MBA program. And it's completely free. Whether you're pre-revenue or scaling past seven figures, these episodes contain frameworks you can implement immediately.</p>

<p>Let's dive into the 12 episodes every entrepreneur should listen to in 2025.</p>

<div id="hormozi" class="ep-card">
<div class="ep-rank">1</div>
<h3>Alex Hormozi — The $100M Offers Framework</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">🎙️ Alex Hormozi, Founder of Acquisition.com</div>
<p>Alex Hormozi's appearance on Diary of a CEO is arguably the single most actionable business episode in the show's history. In roughly 1.5 hours, Hormozi breaks down his entire framework for creating offers so good that people feel stupid saying no. He covers value equations, pricing psychology, and the exact process he used to scale Gym Launch from zero to $100 million.</p>
<p>For entrepreneurs, the key insight is deceptively simple: most businesses fail not because their product is bad, but because their offer is weak. Hormozi explains how to stack bonuses, reverse risk, and create urgency without being sleazy. If you only listen to one episode on this list, make it this one.</p>
<blockquote>"The goal is to make an offer so good that people feel stupid saying no. That's the entire game."<cite>— Alex Hormozi, Founder of Acquisition.com</cite></blockquote>

<h3>Sara Blakely — Building Spanx From $5,000</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">🎙️ Sara Blakely, Founder of Spanx</div>
<p>Sara Blakely's story is one of the most inspiring in entrepreneurial history. She started Spanx with just $5,000 in savings, no business degree, and no experience in fashion. On this episode, she shares the raw, unfiltered journey — from cutting the feet off pantyhose in her apartment to becoming the world's youngest self-made female billionaire.</p>
<p>What makes this episode essential for entrepreneurs is Blakely's mindset. She talks about her father's dinner-table ritual of asking "What did you fail at today?" — a practice that reframed failure as a sign of trying. She also reveals how she got her product into Neiman Marcus without any retail connections, using sheer persistence and creativity.</p>
<p>For early-stage founders struggling with imposter syndrome, this episode is a masterclass in resourcefulness over resources.</p>
<blockquote>"Don't be intimidated by what you don't know. That can be your greatest strength."<cite>— Sara Blakely, Founder of Spanx</cite></blockquote>

<h3>Daniel Priestley — Becoming a Key Person of Influence</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">🎙️ Daniel Priestley, Author & Entrepreneur</div>
<p>Daniel Priestley's episodes on DOAC (he's appeared multiple times) are gold for entrepreneurs thinking about personal branding and market positioning. His "Key Person of Influence" framework outlines five steps to becoming the go-to authority in your industry: pitching, publishing, productizing, profiling, and partnerships.</p>
<p>Priestley argues that in the modern economy, visibility is the new currency. It doesn't matter how good your product is if nobody knows who you are. He gives concrete examples of entrepreneurs who went from unknown to industry leaders by following a systematic approach to building authority.</p>
<p>If you're an entrepreneur who feels like you're the best-kept secret in your industry, this episode will give you a clear roadmap to change that.</p>
<blockquote>"In every industry, there are key people of influence who seem to get all the opportunities. It's not luck — it's a system."<cite>— Daniel Priestley, Author & Entrepreneur</cite></blockquote>

<h3>Codie Sanchez — Buying Boring Businesses</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">🎙️ Codie Sanchez, Founder of Contrarian Thinking</div>
<p>Codie Sanchez challenges the Silicon Valley narrative that entrepreneurship means building the next tech unicorn. Instead, she makes a compelling case for acquiring "boring" businesses — laundromats, car washes, HVAC companies — that generate reliable cash flow without the startup risk.</p>
<p>This episode is a paradigm shift for many entrepreneurs. Sanchez explains seller financing, how to find businesses for sale, and the due diligence process for acquisitions. She reveals that many baby boomers are retiring and desperate to sell profitable businesses, creating a once-in-a-generation opportunity for younger entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>For founders tired of the "build from scratch" grind, this episode opens up an entirely new path to business ownership and financial freedom.</p>
<blockquote>"The sexiest businesses in the world are the most boring ones. They're just cash machines that nobody talks about."<cite>— Codie Sanchez, Founder of Contrarian Thinking</cite></blockquote>

<h3>Gary Vaynerchuk — Day Trading Attention</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">🎙️ Gary Vaynerchuk, CEO of VaynerMedia</div>
<p>Gary Vee has been on the show multiple times, but his 2024 appearance focusing on "day trading attention" is the most relevant for 2025 entrepreneurs. He breaks down why understanding where consumer attention is moving — and getting there first — is the single most important skill for modern business owners.</p>
<p>Vaynerchuk covers platform-specific strategies for TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts, and emerging platforms. He shares real examples of small businesses that exploded by being early to new content formats. His core argument: organic social media is still the most underpriced marketing channel in the world, and most entrepreneurs are wasting money on paid ads when they should be creating content.</p>
<p>Whether you're a solopreneur or running a team of 50, the marketing frameworks in this episode are immediately applicable.</p>
<blockquote>"Attention is the asset. If you know where attention is going and you get there first, everything else follows."<cite>— Gary Vaynerchuk, CEO of VaynerMedia</cite></blockquote>

<h3>Chris Guillebeau — The $100 Startup Mindset</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">🎙️ Chris Guillebeau, Author of The $100 Startup</div>
<p>For aspiring entrepreneurs who haven't taken the leap yet, this episode is the push you need. Guillebeau studied 1,500 people who built businesses earning $50,000 or more from modest investments — often $100 or less. On DOAC, he shares the patterns he discovered.</p>
<p>The biggest takeaway: you don't need a revolutionary idea. You need to find the intersection of something you're good at and something people will pay for. Guillebeau calls this "convergence" and walks through practical exercises to find your sweet spot. He also debunks common myths about needing investors, business plans, or permission to start.</p>
<blockquote>"You don't need to be an expert. You just need to know more than the person you're helping."<cite>— Chris Guillebeau, Author of The $100 Startup</cite></blockquote>

<h3>Steven Bartlett — Lessons From Building Social Chain</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">🎙️ Steven Bartlett, Founder of Social Chain & DOAC</div>
<p>Some of the best entrepreneurial insights on the podcast come from Steven himself. In several solo episodes and reflective conversations, Bartlett shares the raw lessons from building Social Chain from his bedroom in Manchester to a publicly traded company worth over £200 million.</p>
<p>He talks candidly about the mistakes — hiring too fast, ignoring mental health, chasing revenue over profit, and the loneliness of leadership. These aren't the sanitized lessons you read in business books. They're the real, painful insights that only come from lived experience.</p>
<p>For any entrepreneur in the trenches, hearing someone who's been through it talk so honestly is both validating and instructive. Bartlett's key lesson: the unsexy fundamentals — unit economics, cash flow management, hiring slowly — are what actually build lasting businesses.</p>
<blockquote>"I dropped out of university at 18, started a company in my bedroom, and made every mistake you can possibly make. But I wouldn't change a thing."<cite>— Steven Bartlett, Founder of Social Chain</cite></blockquote>

<h3>Vishen Lakhiani — 10X Goals & Entrepreneurial Mindset</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">🎙️ Vishen Lakhiani, Founder of Mindvalley</div>
<p>Vishen Lakhiani built Mindvalley into a global education company reaching millions. On DOAC, he goes deep on the psychology of entrepreneurial ambition — specifically, why most entrepreneurs set goals that are too small.</p>
<p>His "10X vs 2X" framework argues that bigger goals are actually easier to achieve because they force you to rethink your entire approach rather than just working harder. Lakhiani also covers his "Three Most Important Questions" exercise and shares the meditation and visualization practices that top entrepreneurs use daily.</p>
<p>This episode is ideal for entrepreneurs who have plateaued and need a mindset reset to reach the next level.</p>
<blockquote>"When you set a goal 10X bigger, you can't achieve it with the same thinking. You're forced to innovate."<cite>— Vishen Lakhiani, Founder of Mindvalley</cite></blockquote>

<h3>Ali Abdaal — From Part-Time YouTuber to CEO</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">🎙️ Ali Abdaal, YouTuber & Entrepreneur</div>
<p>Ali Abdaal's journey from NHS doctor to running a multi-million-dollar media and education business is a blueprint for the modern creator-entrepreneur. On DOAC, he shares the exact systems and strategies he used to build his YouTube channel, launch courses, and scale a team — all while maintaining work-life balance.</p>
<p>The standout insight is Abdaal's approach to "feel-good productivity" — the idea that sustainable entrepreneurship comes from designing a business around enjoyment, not grinding through misery. He shares his content creation systems, delegation frameworks, and the business model behind a creator-led company.</p>
<p>For entrepreneurs considering the creator economy or wanting to build a personal brand, this is required listening.</p>
<blockquote>"The goal isn't to be productive for productivity's sake. It's to build a life and business you actually enjoy."<cite>— Ali Abdaal, YouTuber & Entrepreneur</cite></blockquote>

<h3>Noah Kagan — The Million-Dollar Weekend</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">🎙️ Noah Kagan, Founder of AppSumo</div>
<p>Noah Kagan was employee #30 at Facebook and #4 at Mint.com before founding AppSumo, now a $100M+ business. His DOAC episode is a masterclass in rapid validation and getting your first customers fast.</p>
<p>Kagan's core philosophy: you can validate any business idea in 48 hours. He walks through his "Coffee Challenge" (asking for 10% off your next coffee to build rejection tolerance), the "Million-Dollar Weekend" framework for launching businesses quickly, and real examples of entrepreneurs who went from idea to revenue in days, not months.</p>
<p>For entrepreneurs stuck in "planning mode," this episode is the antidote. Kagan's energy is contagious, and his frameworks are brutally practical.</p>
<blockquote>"Business is not about finding ideas. It's about finding customers. Go talk to people."<cite>— Noah Kagan, Founder of AppSumo</cite></blockquote>

<h3>Ed Mylett — The Power of One More</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">🎙️ Ed Mylett, Entrepreneur & Peak Performance Coach</div>
<p>Ed Mylett's episode is raw, emotional, and deeply practical. His "One More" philosophy is simple but powerful: in every area of your life and business, do one more rep, make one more call, have one more conversation. The compound effect of this mindset over months and years is staggering.</p>
<p>Mylett shares stories from building his financial services empire, the daily habits of ultra-successful entrepreneurs, and his framework for "raising your thermostat" — essentially, expanding your identity to match your ambitions. For entrepreneurs who feel like they're working hard but not breaking through, this episode identifies the invisible ceiling holding you back.</p>
<blockquote>"Most people stop when they're tired. Champions stop when they're done. And the difference is usually just one more."<cite>— Ed Mylett, Entrepreneur & Peak Performance Coach</cite></blockquote>

<h3>Simon Sinek — Start With Why (Still)</h3>
<div class="ep-guest">🎙️ Simon Sinek, Author of Start With Why</div>
<p>Simon Sinek's appearance on DOAC goes far beyond the TED talk that made him famous. He dives into the practical application of "why" for entrepreneurs — how to use purpose as a competitive advantage, build a team that believes in your mission, and make decisions when everything is uncertain.</p>
<p>Sinek also addresses the loneliness of entrepreneurship, the difference between finite and infinite games in business, and why the most successful companies are built to last, not built to exit. His conversation with Bartlett is unusually personal, covering vulnerability, leadership, and what success actually means when you strip away the money.</p>
<p>For entrepreneurs building something they want to last, this episode provides the philosophical foundation that tactics alone can't give you.</p>
<blockquote>"People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe."<cite>— Simon Sinek, Author of Start With Why</cite></blockquote>

<h2>How to Get the Most From These Episodes</h2>

<p>Listening to podcasts passively is entertainment. Listening actively is education. Here's how to turn these episodes into real business results:</p>

<p><strong>1. Take notes on one actionable idea per episode.</strong> You don't need to implement everything. Pick the single insight most relevant to where you are right now and write it down.</p>

<p><strong>2. Implement within 48 hours.</strong> The gap between learning and doing is where most entrepreneurs fail. If Alex Hormozi teaches you about offer stacking, rewrite your offer before the week is out.</p>

<p><strong>3. Share with your team.</strong> Many of these episodes work brilliantly as team listening. Play them during team meetings and discuss how the concepts apply to your business.</p>

<p><strong>4. Revisit episodes as you grow.</strong> An episode that didn't resonate at £10K/month might be life-changing at £100K/month. Your stage of business determines what you're ready to hear.</p>

<p><strong>5. Explore related episodes.</strong> Use our <a href="/topics">topics page</a> to find episodes grouped by theme — money, mindset, health, relationships, and more.</p>

<h2>What Makes Diary of a CEO Different for Entrepreneurs</h2>

<p>There's no shortage of business podcasts. So why has Diary of a CEO become the top recommendation for entrepreneurs worldwide? Three reasons:</p>

<p><strong>Depth over breadth.</strong> Episodes run 1.5 hours or more. That's enough time to get past the surface-level advice and into the real, nuanced lessons that actually change how you think about business.</p>

<p><strong>Diverse guests.</strong> From billionaire investors to bootstrapped solopreneurs, from neuroscientists to ex-convicts turned CEOs — the range of perspectives means you're getting a 360-degree education in what it takes to succeed.</p>

<p><strong>Steven's own journey.</strong> Unlike many podcast hosts, Bartlett has actually built and scaled businesses. He asks the questions an entrepreneur would ask, not the questions a journalist would ask. That makes all the difference.</p>

<h2>Start Listening Today</h2>

<p>If you're an entrepreneur in 2025, these 12 episodes represent hundreds of hours of real-world business experience compressed into digestible conversations. Start with the episode most relevant to your current challenge — whether that's creating better offers (Hormozi), building a personal brand (Priestley), or finding the courage to start (Blakely) — and work your way through the list.</p>
