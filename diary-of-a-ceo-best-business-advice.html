        <h1>Best Business Advice from Diary of a CEO — 15 Lessons That Changed How I Think About Everything</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">I've listened to hundreds of hours of DOAC so you don't have to. These are the business lessons that actually stuck — the ones I find myself repeating in meetings, texting to friends, and thinking about at 2am.</p>

        <p>Look, I love <strong>Diary of a CEO</strong>. It's genuinely the podcast that made me rethink how I approach work, money, and building things. But let's be honest — not everyone has time to sit through a 1.5 hour podcast every week, let alone catch up on the backlog of 400+ episodes.</p>

        <p>So I went through the entire catalogue. Every business-focused episode. Every founder interview. Every moment where Steven Bartlett or a guest dropped something that made me pause and rewind. And I pulled out the <strong>15 best business lessons from Diary of a CEO</strong> that I genuinely believe could change how you think about building a career, a company, or just... a life that actually works.</p>

        <p>These aren't generic platitudes. These are specific, actionable ideas from people who've actually done it — from billion-dollar founders to psychologists who study why we self-sabotage. Let's get into it.</p>

        <h2 id="lesson-1"><span class="lesson-number">1</span> The "Fill Your Five Buckets" Framework</h2>

        <p>This one comes straight from Steven Bartlett himself, and it's probably the single most referenced framework from the entire podcast. Steven talks about five buckets that every person needs to fill: <strong>knowledge, skills, network, resources, and reputation</strong>.</p>

        <p>The key insight isn't just that these buckets exist — it's the <em>order</em>. Most people try to fill the resources bucket first (chase the money). But Steven argues you should fill them roughly in order. Knowledge first. Then skills. Then network. Then resources come almost automatically, and reputation follows.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "In the early stages of your career, you should be optimizing for knowledge and skills, not money. The money is a lagging indicator of the value you can create."
            <cite>— Steven Bartlett, CEO of Social Chain</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>What makes this so powerful is how it reframes early-career decisions. That job that pays less but teaches you more? Take it. That side project that won't make money but builds a skill? Do it. You're filling buckets that will overflow later.</p>

        <p>I think about this framework constantly. When I'm deciding between opportunities, I ask: "Which bucket does this fill?" If it fills knowledge or skills and I'm early in my journey, that's usually the right call — even if the money isn't there yet.</p>

        <h2 id="lesson-2"><span class="lesson-number">2</span> Nobody Cares About Your Business Until You Make Them Care</h2>

        <p>This is a brutal truth that comes up again and again across <a href="/episodes">DOAC episodes</a>, particularly from marketing-focused guests. The world is drowning in content, products, and pitches. Your thing — no matter how good — starts at zero attention.</p>

        <p>Steven's own story with Social Chain illustrates this perfectly. They didn't build a social media company by being the best — they built it by being the most impossible to ignore. They engineered viral moments. They studied what made people stop scrolling.</p>

        <p>The lesson for any business: <strong>distribution beats product</strong>. Not forever — eventually you need a great product. But in the beginning, the business that figures out how to get in front of people wins over the business that builds in silence hoping to be discovered.</p>

        <p>This doesn't mean being spammy or annoying. It means understanding that attention is the first currency of business, and you need a strategy for earning it. Whether that's content, partnerships, stunts, or community — you need a plan for getting noticed.</p>

        <h2 id="lesson-3"><span class="lesson-number">3</span> The Diary Technique for Decision-Making</h2>

        <p>This is one of those deceptively simple ideas that actually works. Multiple guests have referenced some version of this, but the core concept is: <strong>write down every major decision you make and why you made it, then review quarterly</strong>.</p>

        <p>It sounds obvious. But almost nobody does it. And the reason it's powerful is that it eliminates revisionist history. You can't tell yourself "I always knew that would happen" when you have written proof of what you actually thought at the time.</p>

        <p>Over time, you start to see patterns. You notice which types of decisions you consistently get right, and which you consistently get wrong. Maybe you're great at product decisions but terrible at hiring decisions. Maybe you rush into partnerships but take too long on pivots.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "The most successful people I know are obsessive about understanding their own decision-making patterns. They don't just learn from mistakes — they study why the mistakes happened in the first place."
            <cite>— Daniel Kahneman-style thinking, referenced across multiple DOAC episodes</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Start a decision journal. Seriously. It takes five minutes per entry and it compounds like nothing else in business.</p>

        <h2 id="lesson-4"><span class="lesson-number">4</span> Revenue Is Vanity, Profit Is Sanity</h2>

        <p>This one hits different in the post-2022 business world. For years, the startup ecosystem celebrated top-line revenue growth above everything. Raise money, burn cash, grow fast, figure out profitability later. Multiple DOAC guests — especially those who lived through the corrections — have torn this mindset apart.</p>

        <p>The advice isn't to avoid growth. It's to understand the difference between <strong>healthy growth and sugar-high growth</strong>. Revenue that costs you £1.20 to earn every £1 isn't revenue — it's subsidized activity. And at some point, the subsidy runs out.</p>

        <p>Steven himself has talked about this shift in his thinking. His earlier ventures were about growth at all costs. His later thinking is much more focused on unit economics, margins, and building businesses that actually make money from day one or very soon after.</p>

        <p>For anyone starting a business: know your numbers. Not just revenue, but cost of acquisition, lifetime value, gross margin, and burn rate. The founders who survive are the ones who can read a P&L as fluently as they read a tweet.</p>

        <h2 id="lesson-5"><span class="lesson-number">5</span> You Don't Need Permission to Start</h2>

        <p>This comes up in almost every single founder interview on DOAC, and it's one of those lessons that sounds like a motivational poster until you actually hear the stories behind it.</p>

        <p>Steven started his first business from his university bedroom in Manchester. He didn't wait for investors, advisors, or the perfect moment. He just started. And nearly every successful founder on the show has a similar story — they started before they were ready, before they had the resources, before anyone gave them the green light.</p>

        <p>The deeper lesson here is about <strong>the cost of waiting</strong>. Every day you spend planning instead of doing is a day of feedback you're not getting. The market doesn't care about your business plan — it cares about what you actually ship.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "The biggest risk in business isn't doing something and failing. It's spending years thinking about doing something and never starting."
            <cite>— A recurring theme across Diary of a CEO episodes</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This doesn't mean being reckless. It means recognizing that the gap between "ready" and "starting" is often an illusion. You learn by doing, not by preparing to do.</p>

        <h2 id="lesson-6"><span class="lesson-number">6</span> Hire Slowly, Fire Quickly — But Do It With Humanity</h2>

        <p>People decisions come up constantly on DOAC, and for good reason — they're probably the most consequential decisions any business leader makes. The consensus from guests who've scaled companies is clear: take your time hiring, and don't delay when someone isn't working out.</p>

        <p>But what makes the DOAC version of this advice different from the typical Silicon Valley version is the emphasis on <strong>doing it with humanity</strong>. Several guests have pushed back on the idea that "fire fast" means being cold or ruthless. Instead, it means being honest early — having the hard conversation at week 3, not month 6.</p>

        <p>The worst thing you can do to someone who isn't right for a role is let them stay in it for a year. That's not kindness — that's cowardice dressed up as compassion. The kind thing is to be honest, help them transition, and free them to find somewhere they'll actually thrive.</p>

        <h2 id="lesson-7"><span class="lesson-number">7</span> Your Network Is Your Net Worth (But Not How You Think)</h2>

        <p>This is a cliché that gets completely reframed on DOAC. The typical networking advice is transactional: go to events, collect business cards, follow up. But the guests who've built the most valuable networks describe something totally different.</p>

        <p>They talk about <strong>leading with value</strong>. Not "what can this person do for me?" but "what can I do for this person right now, with no expectation of return?" That's the whole game. The people who build the best networks are the ones who are most useful to others.</p>

        <p>Steven's own network — which now includes some of the most successful people on the planet — wasn't built through cold outreach or networking events. It was built through creating content that provided value, being genuinely curious about people, and being someone others want to be around.</p>

        <p>The practical takeaway: before you ask for anything from your network, spend six months giving. Share introductions, offer help, create content, solve problems. The returns come later, and they come bigger than you'd expect.</p>

        <h2 id="lesson-8"><span class="lesson-number">8</span> The 30% Rule for Innovation</h2>

        <p>This is a framework that's come up in several entrepreneurship-focused episodes. The idea is that <strong>the best innovations aren't 10x improvements — they're 30% improvements applied consistently</strong>.</p>

        <p>Most people think innovation means inventing something completely new. But the reality is that most successful businesses take something that already exists and make it 30% better, 30% cheaper, or 30% more convenient. That's enough to win if you do it consistently across every touchpoint.</p>

        <p>Think about it: Uber didn't invent transportation. They made hailing a car ~30% easier across several dimensions — finding a car, paying, knowing when it arrives. Each individual improvement was incremental. Together, they were revolutionary.</p>

        <p>For your business: stop trying to reinvent the wheel. Look at what your competitors do and ask, "How can I make each step 30% better?" Stack enough of those improvements and you've built something genuinely differentiated.</p>

        <h2 id="lesson-9"><span class="lesson-number">9</span> Storytelling Is the Most Underrated Business Skill</h2>

        <p>If there's one meta-lesson from watching Steven Bartlett operate, it's that the ability to tell a story is the single most valuable skill in business. Not coding. Not finance. Not even sales. <strong>Storytelling.</strong></p>

        <p>Think about what storytelling actually does in a business context. It helps you recruit (people join stories, not spreadsheets). It helps you fundraise (investors buy narratives about the future). It helps you sell (customers connect with stories, not features). It helps you lead (teams rally around missions, not metrics).</p>

        <p>Multiple guests have made this point, but it really crystallizes when you watch how Steven himself communicates. He doesn't present data — he tells stories with data in them. Every DOAC episode is structured as a narrative, not an interview. That's not an accident.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Facts tell, stories sell. If you can't wrap your business idea in a narrative that makes people feel something, you're going to struggle — no matter how good the idea is."
            <cite>— A lesson echoed by marketers, founders, and investors across DOAC</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 id="lesson-10"><span class="lesson-number">10</span> Uncomfortable Conversations Create Breakthroughs</h2>

        <p>This is one of those lessons that applies to business and life equally. Across hundreds of episodes, there's a clear pattern: <strong>the most successful people are the ones most willing to have uncomfortable conversations</strong>.</p>

        <p>With co-founders about equity. With employees about performance. With investors about bad news. With customers about price. With themselves about what's not working.</p>

        <p>The avoidance of uncomfortable conversations is probably the single biggest source of business failure that doesn't get talked about enough. Companies don't usually die because of bad strategy — they die because nobody was willing to say "this isn't working" early enough.</p>

        <p>Explore more on this topic in our <a href="/topics">topics section</a>, where we break down DOAC conversations by theme, including leadership and difficult conversations.</p>

        <h2 id="lesson-11"><span class="lesson-number">11</span> The Law of Compounding Applies to Everything</h2>

        <p>This is perhaps the most powerful mental model discussed on DOAC, and it extends far beyond finance. Yes, compound interest makes money grow. But compounding also applies to <strong>skills, relationships, reputation, and knowledge</strong>.</p>

        <p>The person who writes one blog post a week for five years doesn't have 260 blog posts — they have a body of work, a refined skill, an audience, and opportunities that wouldn't exist without the compound effect of consistency.</p>

        <p>Steven's own career is a masterclass in compounding. Each venture built on the last. Each podcast episode grew the audience slightly, which attracted bigger guests, which grew the audience more. The flywheel of compounding made each year dramatically more productive than the last.</p>

        <p>The practical implication: <strong>choose activities with compounding returns and be insanely patient</strong>. The first year of anything looks like nothing. The fifth year looks like magic. Most people quit in year two.</p>

        <h2 id="lesson-12"><span class="lesson-number">12</span> Build for Your Customer's Customer</h2>

        <p>This is a more advanced business insight that comes from several B2B-focused episodes. The idea is simple but profound: <strong>don't just solve your customer's problem — solve their customer's problem</strong>.</p>

        <p>When you help your customer serve their customers better, you become indispensable. You're not a vendor anymore — you're a partner in their success. And that changes everything about the relationship, the pricing power, and the retention.</p>

        <p>This applies even in consumer businesses. If you're building an app for creators, don't just think about what the creator wants — think about what the creator's audience wants. Build features that make the creator look good to their people, and you'll never lose that creator as a customer.</p>

        <h2 id="lesson-13"><span class="lesson-number">13</span> The "Monday Morning Test" for Business Ideas</h2>

        <p>This is a simple gut-check that's been referenced in various forms across DOAC episodes about entrepreneurship. The test: <strong>imagine it's Monday morning and you have to work on this business for the next 10 years. Does that excite you or drain you?</strong></p>

        <p>It sounds simplistic, but it eliminates a surprising number of "good on paper" ideas. Lots of businesses look attractive from the outside — great market, clear demand, obvious model. But if the daily reality of running that business makes you want to hide under the covers on Monday morning, it's the wrong business for you.</p>

        <p>This doesn't mean every day has to be fun. Building anything worthwhile involves plenty of tedious, difficult, unglamorous work. But there's a difference between hard-but-meaningful and soul-crushing. The Monday Morning Test helps you tell the difference.</p>

        <h2 id="lesson-14"><span class="lesson-number">14</span> Failure Isn't the Opposite of Success — It's Part of It</h2>

        <p>I know, I know — this sounds like another motivational poster. But hear me out, because the way this gets discussed on DOAC is genuinely different from the typical "embrace failure" platitude.</p>

        <p>The distinction that multiple guests make is between <strong>failure as an event and failure as an identity</strong>. A business failing is an event — it happened, you learn from it, you move on. But many people internalize business failure as a personal identity — "I am a failure" — and that's what actually stops them.</p>

        <p>Steven's been remarkably open about his early failures and the ventures that didn't work. What's notable is how he frames them: not as character-building exercises or badges of honor, but simply as <strong>data points</strong>. Each failure taught him something specific that he applied to the next venture.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "I don't celebrate failure. I don't romanticize it. But I refuse to let it define me. Every business that didn't work out gave me something I used in the one that did."
            <cite>— A paraphrased sentiment from Steven Bartlett across multiple episodes</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 id="lesson-15"><span class="lesson-number">15</span> Your Health Is Your First Business</h2>

        <p>This might seem like an odd inclusion in a list of business lessons, but it's come up so consistently on DOAC — from health experts, neuroscientists, and the founders themselves — that it would be dishonest to leave it out.</p>

        <p>The argument is straightforward: <strong>your body and mind are the platform on which your business runs</strong>. If the platform is degrading — bad sleep, no exercise, poor nutrition, chronic stress — then everything you build on top of it is compromised.</p>

        <p>This isn't about hustle culture or "optimize your biology for maximum productivity." It's about recognizing that the entrepreneurial journey is a marathon measured in decades, and the people who last are the ones who take care of the machine.</p>

        <p>Sleep comes up most frequently. Multiple guests — from neuroscientist Matthew Walker to various founders who burned out — have hammered the point that sleep deprivation doesn't make you more productive. It makes you worse at everything: decisions, creativity, emotional regulation, and health. The "I'll sleep when I'm dead" mentality literally makes you die sooner.</p>

        <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

        <p>If I had to distill these 15 lessons into one unifying principle, it would be this: <strong>the best business advice from Diary of a CEO isn't about business tactics — it's about becoming the kind of person who builds great businesses</strong>.</p>

        <p>Fill your buckets in order. Make better decisions by studying your past decisions. Build for compounding returns. Have the uncomfortable conversations. Take care of your health. Start before you're ready.</p>

        <p>None of this requires a massive budget, a Harvard MBA, or a lucky break. It requires intention, patience, and the willingness to keep showing up even when the results aren't visible yet.</p>

        <p>That's the real gift of DOAC as a podcast — it doesn't just teach you business strategies. It exposes you to hundreds of different people who've walked the path, and through their stories, you start to see the patterns that actually matter.</p>

        <p>These 15 lessons are my attempt to capture those patterns. I hope they're as useful to you as they've been to me.</p>
