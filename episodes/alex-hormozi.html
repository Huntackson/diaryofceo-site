        <h2 class="section-title">📝 Episode Summary</h2>
        <div class="episode-summary">
            <p>In this episode, Alex Hormozi breaks down the exact principles and strategies he has used to build multiple businesses generating hundreds of millions of dollars. Known as "the man that makes millionaires," Alex shares his framework for creating irresistible offers, scaling businesses, and building lasting wealth.</p>
<p>Alex starts with his core philosophy: the fastest way to make money is to make other people money. He explains why most entrepreneurs fail — not because they don't work hard enough, but because they're solving problems no one is willing to pay for. He introduces his "$100M Offers" framework for creating products and services so good that people feel stupid saying no.</p>
<p>The conversation covers Alex's personal journey from sleeping on the floor of his gym to building a portfolio of companies. He discusses the pressure of external expectations set by social media, why comparison is the thief of joy, and how his relationship with his wife Leila has been central to his success.</p>
<p>Steven pushes Alex on the intersection of wealth and happiness. Alex offers a surprisingly philosophical perspective — he argues that unhappiness comes from the gap between expectations and reality, and that managing expectations is just as important as improving your circumstances. He provides practical frameworks for anyone looking to start or scale a business.</p>
