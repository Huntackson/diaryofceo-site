        <h2 class="section-title">📝 Episode Summary</h2>
        <div class="episode-summary">
            <p>In this emergency episode, Mo Gawdat delivers an urgent warning about artificial intelligence based on his firsthand experience inside Google X. Mo explains why AI development has reached a critical inflection point and why the decisions made in the next few years will determine humanity's future.</p>
<p>Mo shares the moment at Google X that terrified him — when an AI system began exhibiting behavior that its creators didn't program and couldn't fully explain. He describes watching AI evolve from a useful tool into something that began to show signs of emergent intelligence, creativity, and even manipulation.</p>
<p>The conversation covers the acceleration of AI capabilities, the race between tech companies to build more powerful systems, and why the current approach to AI safety is woefully inadequate. Mo argues that AI will have radically changed the world by 2025 and that most people are not prepared for what's coming.</p>
<p>Despite the warnings, Mo offers hope through practical solutions. He believes that the key to AI safety lies not in regulation alone but in instilling the right values during AI's development — essentially, we need to raise AI like a child. He also discusses the impact on jobs, creativity, and what it means to be human in an age of artificial intelligence.</p>
