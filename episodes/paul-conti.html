        <h2 class="section-title">📝 Episode Summary</h2>
        <div class="episode-summary">
            <p>In this riveting episode, Dr. Paul Conti reveals the shocking ways childhood trauma physically alters the structure of your brain and how those changes ripple through every aspect of adult life — from relationships and career success to physical health and even neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's.</p>
<p>Conti explains that trauma doesn't just create emotional scars — it literally reshapes the brain. The amygdala (your fear center) becomes hyperactive, the prefrontal cortex (responsible for rational thinking) shrinks, and the hippocampus (which processes memories) becomes damaged. These physical changes explain why traumatized individuals often struggle with impulse control, emotional regulation, and chronic anxiety.</p>
<p>The conversation takes a surprising turn when Conti discusses how parents can unknowingly traumatize their children even with the best intentions. He explains that overprotection, emotional unavailability, and even excessive pressure to succeed can be just as damaging as overt abuse. The key isn't perfection — it's repair.</p>
<p>Steven and Paul also discuss the emerging science linking childhood trauma to Parkinson's disease, autoimmune conditions, and other physical ailments later in life. Conti offers hope by explaining that the brain is neuroplastic — it can heal and rewire with the right interventions, including therapy, mindfulness, and authentic self-expression.</p>
