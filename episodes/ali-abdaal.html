        <h2 class="section-title">📝 Episode Summary</h2>
        <div class="episode-summary">
            <p>In this episode, Ali Abdaal joins Steven to break down the science and art of productivity — and why most people's approach to getting things done is fundamentally broken. Ali argues that productivity isn't about doing more; it's about doing what matters with less friction and more enjoyment.</p>
<p>Ali shares his journey from a Cambridge medical student who finished top of his year to building a multi-million-dollar content business. He explains how he mastered the art of learning efficiently, producing content consistently, and managing his time without burning out.</p>
<p>The conversation covers Ali's core productivity frameworks, including the concept of "feel-good productivity" — the idea that the most productive people aren't those who grind the hardest but those who find ways to make their work enjoyable. He explains the science behind why positive emotions enhance cognitive function, creativity, and output.</p>
<p>Steven and Ali also discuss common productivity myths, including the danger of to-do lists, why multitasking is a lie, and how perfectionism is the enemy of progress. Ali provides specific tools and techniques for beating procrastination, building consistent habits, and designing a life that balances ambition with well-being.</p>
