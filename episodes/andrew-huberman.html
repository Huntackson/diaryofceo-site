        <h2 class="section-title">📝 Episode Summary</h2>
        <div class="episode-summary">
            <p>In this fascinating episode, Dr. Andrew Huberman breaks down the neuroscience behind dopamine — the molecule that drives motivation, focus, and desire — and explains why most people are unknowingly depleting their reserves through the hustle culture of chasing constant highs.</p>
<p>Huberman explains that dopamine is not about pleasure itself but about the anticipation of reward. He reveals how activities like social media scrolling, constant stimulation, and even excessive cold shower protocols can dysregulate your dopamine system, leading to chronic exhaustion and lack of motivation.</p>
<p>The conversation covers the science of cold exposure, debunking many popular myths. While cold showers can boost dopamine by up to 250%, Huberman warns that the timing, duration, and frequency matter enormously. He provides specific protocols for using cold exposure effectively without burning out your neurochemistry.</p>
<p>Steven and Andrew also discuss the importance of morning sunlight exposure for circadian rhythm regulation, the neuroscience of focus and attention, and practical tools for managing energy throughout the day. Huberman emphasizes that rest isn't laziness — it's essential for maintaining the dopamine baseline that drives long-term performance.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">💬 Key Quotes</h2>
        <blockquote>"Dopamine is not about the pursuit of happiness. It's about the happiness of pursuit."</blockquote>
        <blockquote>"The biggest mistake people make is they spike their dopamine too high, too often, and wonder why they can't focus."</blockquote>
        <blockquote>"Morning sunlight is the most powerful tool we have for regulating our entire biology."</blockquote>
        <blockquote>"Rest is not laziness. Rest is when your brain consolidates learning and replenishes neurochemicals."</blockquote>
        <blockquote>"Cold exposure can increase dopamine by 250%, but only if done correctly — timing matters."</blockquote>
        <blockquote>"Your phone is a dopamine slot machine. Every notification is a pull of the lever."</blockquote>

        <h2 class="section-title">🎯 Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ol class="takeaways-list">
            <li>Dopamine is about motivation and anticipation, not pleasure — protect your baseline levels.</li>
            <li>Avoid constant dopamine spikes from phones and social media — they lead to chronic low motivation.</li>
            <li>Morning sunlight exposure (10-30 minutes) is the single best tool for energy and sleep regulation.</li>
            <li>Cold exposure works but must be done strategically — don't overdo frequency or duration.</li>
            <li>Build in deliberate rest periods — your brain needs downtime to consolidate learning and restore neurochemistry.</li>
            <li>Delay gratification intentionally — the ability to tolerate boredom is a superpower in the modern world.</li>
        </ol>
