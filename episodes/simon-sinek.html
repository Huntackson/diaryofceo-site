        <h2 class="section-title">📝 Episode Summary</h2>
        <div class="episode-summary">
            <p>In this powerful conversation, Simon Sinek joins Steven Bartlett to explore why so many people struggle to find success and fulfillment in their personal and professional lives. Sinek argues that the number one reason people fail isn't a lack of talent or opportunity — it's a fundamental misunderstanding of what drives lasting achievement.</p>
<p>Sinek breaks down the concept of the "infinite game" — the idea that life and business aren't about winning or losing, but about staying in the game long enough to make a meaningful impact. He explains how most people approach their careers with a finite mindset, chasing short-term wins and external validation rather than building something that endures.</p>
<p>The conversation dives deep into the importance of finding your "why" — the purpose, cause, or belief that inspires you to do what you do. Sinek shares personal stories about his own struggles with motivation and how rediscovering his purpose transformed his career and relationships.</p>
<p>They also discuss the loneliness epidemic, the erosion of trust in institutions, and why genuine human connection is more important than ever in an increasingly digital world. Sinek offers practical advice on building trust within teams, creating environments where people feel safe to be vulnerable, and why leaders must eat last.</p>
