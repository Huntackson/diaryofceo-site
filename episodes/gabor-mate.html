        <h2 class="section-title">📝 Episode Summary</h2>
        <div class="episode-summary">
            <p>In this profound and deeply moving conversation, Dr. Gabor Maté explores how childhood trauma lodges itself in the body and manifests as adult dysfunction, addiction, and chronic illness. He challenges the conventional understanding of trauma, arguing that it's not about what happened to you — it's about what happened inside you as a result.</p>
<p>Maté explains that the "childhood lie" is the belief that something is wrong with you — a belief formed when your emotional needs went unmet as a child. He defines trauma not just as abuse or neglect but as any experience where a child's authentic self was suppressed in order to maintain attachment with caregivers.</p>
<p>The conversation dives deep into the connection between emotional suppression and physical disease. Maté presents compelling evidence that conditions like autoimmune disorders, chronic pain, and even cancer can be linked to unprocessed childhood trauma. He explains how the stress of suppressing your true self weakens the immune system over time.</p>
<p>Steven opens up about his own childhood experiences, creating one of the podcast's most emotionally raw moments. Maté guides him through understanding how early wounds shape adult patterns in relationships, work, and self-worth. The episode offers hope through the message that healing is always possible through awareness, compassion, and reconnecting with your authentic self.</p>
