        <h2 class="section-title">📝 Episode Summary</h2>
        <div class="episode-summary">
            <p>In this landmark episode, Tony Robbins delivers a powerful message about why the next decade will be the most transformative — and potentially devastating — period in human history. He discusses the convergence of AI, automation, economic shifts, and social upheaval that will fundamentally reshape society.</p>
<p>Robbins shares what shaped his life's mission, starting with a stranger's act of kindness during his challenging childhood. Growing up poor, Tony's family received a Thanksgiving meal from an anonymous donor — an experience that planted the seed for his lifelong mission to help others and his conviction that strangers can change the world through small acts of generosity.</p>
<p>The conversation covers Tony's frameworks for emotional mastery, including his belief that the quality of your life is the quality of your emotions. He explains why most people let external circumstances dictate their emotional state rather than taking control of their inner world. Tony provides specific techniques for changing your state in seconds.</p>
<p>Steven and Tony also discuss the future of work, wealth inequality, and why the people who thrive in the next decade will be those who embrace change, develop emotional resilience, and focus on serving others. Robbins argues that the greatest risk isn't AI replacing jobs — it's people failing to adapt their mindset to a rapidly changing world.</p>
