        <h2 class="section-title">📝 Episode Summary</h2>
        <div class="episode-summary">
            <p>In this deeply personal episode, Tim Ferriss opens up about his lifelong battle with depression and childhood trauma — and reveals the four science-backed tools that finally helped him heal after decades of suffering. This is a raw, vulnerable Tim Ferriss that most people have never seen.</p>
<p>Tim shares his framework for accelerated learning and its application to mental health recovery. He breaks down how to acquire new coping skills through his structured approach of deconstructing goals, applying the 80/20 principle, and creating effective incentives for behavior change.</p>
<p>The four tools Tim discusses include: psychedelic-assisted therapy (specifically psilocybin), bioelectric medicine and vagus nerve stimulation, structured journaling practices, and somatic experiencing therapy. For each tool, Tim provides the scientific evidence, his personal experience, and practical guidance for listeners interested in exploring these approaches.</p>
<p>Steven and Tim also discuss the stigma around mental health in high-achieving circles, why success can actually make depression worse by removing the "excuses" for unhappiness, and how Tim's approach to self-experimentation has given him a unique perspective on what actually works versus what's just marketing hype.</p>
