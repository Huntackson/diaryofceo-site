<div class="summary-content">
<h2>The Hidden Cost of Child Stardom</h2>
<p>Cole Sprouse opens this deeply personal conversation by describing what it was really like growing up as one of the most recognizable child actors in the world. From 'Big Daddy' with Adam Sandler to 'The Suite Life of Zack & Cody' on Disney Channel, Cole's childhood was anything but normal. He describes the surreal experience of being recognized everywhere as a child, unable to understand why strangers knew his name.</p>
<p>The conversation takes a raw turn when Cole discusses his mother's role in his early career. He describes her as narcissistic — someone whose sense of identity and worth became entirely wrapped up in her children's fame and success. Cole explains how this dynamic meant his childhood feelings, needs, and boundaries were consistently subordinated to the demands of the industry and his mother's emotional needs.</p>

<h2>Identity Crisis and the Disney Machine</h2>
<p>Cole describes the particular challenge of forming an identity when the world already has one assigned to you. As a Disney star, he was expected to maintain a wholesome, approachable persona at all times. Any deviation — normal teenage rebellion, emotional struggles, interest in darker art — was discouraged or punished. This created a profound disconnection between his public self and his inner experience.</p>
<p>He discusses the transition from child actor to adult, which he calls one of the hardest things he's ever done. The industry largely discards child stars once they age out of their marketable window, and many former child actors struggle with addiction, mental health crises, and identity confusion. Cole credits his twin brother Dylan and a conscious decision to step away from acting temporarily with helping him survive this transition.</p>

<h2>Photography as Salvation</h2>
<p>One of the most moving parts of the conversation is Cole's description of how photography saved him. After spending his entire childhood being photographed — often without his meaningful consent — choosing to pick up a camera and be behind the lens was a radical act of reclaiming agency. Photography gave him a way to express himself creatively on his own terms, without the pressure of performance or public expectation.</p>
<p>Cole describes photography as a form of meditation and therapy. Through his lens, he could observe the world quietly, without being the object of observation. This shift in perspective was transformative for his mental health and his sense of self.</p>

<h2>Healing and Forgiveness</h2>
<p>Steven pushes Cole on his relationship with his mother today. Cole's answer is nuanced — he describes a process of understanding that his mother was herself a product of her own unresolved trauma, and that her narcissism was a coping mechanism rather than deliberate cruelty. This understanding doesn't excuse the harm done, but it creates space for compassion.</p>
<p>Cole emphasizes that healing from a narcissistic parent requires grieving the childhood you didn't have — the normal experiences, the unconditional love, the freedom to be a kid. He describes this grief as ongoing rather than something that reaches a neat resolution, but insists that engaging with it honestly is far better than suppressing it.</p>
