        <h2 class="section-title">📝 Episode Summary</h2>
        <div class="episode-summary">
            <p>In this deeply personal episode, Jay Shetty shares his eight fundamental rules for building meaningful relationships and navigating the complexities of love, sex, and intimacy. Drawing from his years as a monk and his subsequent journey into marriage and modern life, Jay bridges ancient wisdom with contemporary challenges.</p>
<p>Jay explains why most relationships fail not because of incompatibility but because of a lack of self-awareness. He argues that until you understand your own attachment style, communication patterns, and emotional triggers, you'll keep repeating the same cycles in every relationship.</p>
<p>The conversation explores the difference between love and attachment, why vulnerability is the gateway to deep connection, and how to have difficult conversations without destroying trust. Jay shares practical frameworks for resolving conflict, including his "STOP" method for de-escalating arguments.</p>
<p>Steven and Jay also discuss the impact of social media on modern dating, the pressure of comparison, and why the grass isn't greener on the other side — it's greener where you water it. Jay emphasizes that the happiest relationships require three simple things: shared values, mutual growth, and intentional time together.</p>
