        <h2 class="section-title">📝 Episode Summary</h2>
        <div class="episode-summary">
            <p>In this eye-opening episode, Professor Matthew Walker reveals why sleep is the single most important thing you can do for your health, brain function, and longevity — and why almost everything you've been told about sleep is wrong.</p>
<p>Walker shares the devastating consequences of sleep deprivation, including its links to Alzheimer's disease, cancer, heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and mental health disorders. He explains that sleeping less than seven hours per night on a regular basis demolishes your immune system and more than doubles your risk of cancer.</p>
<p>The conversation covers Walker's six essential sleep hacks: maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, keeping your bedroom cool (around 18°C/65°F), avoiding caffeine after noon, limiting alcohol, getting morning sunlight, and creating a wind-down routine. Walker explains the science behind each recommendation with clarity and urgency.</p>
<p>Steven and Matthew also discuss the myth of the "sleep machismo" culture — the belief that sleeping less makes you more productive. Walker presents compelling evidence that every major industrial disaster in history, from Chernobyl to the Challenger explosion, has been linked to sleep deprivation. He argues that society's dismissal of sleep is the greatest public health crisis of our time.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">💬 Key Quotes</h2>
        <blockquote>"The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do for your brain and body."</blockquote>
        <blockquote>"There is no major organ in the body or process in the brain that isn't optimally enhanced by sleep."</blockquote>
        <blockquote>"After just one night of only four or five hours of sleep, your natural killer cells drop by 70%."</blockquote>
        <blockquote>"Caffeine has a half-life of five to six hours. A quarter of that coffee you had at noon is still in your brain at midnight."</blockquote>
        <blockquote>"The best bridge between despair and hope is a good night's sleep."</blockquote>
        <blockquote>"Human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent reason."</blockquote>

        <h2 class="section-title">🎯 Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ol class="takeaways-list">
            <li>Sleep is non-negotiable — it is the foundation upon which all other health habits are built.</li>
            <li>Maintain a consistent sleep schedule — go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends.</li>
            <li>Keep your bedroom cool (18°C/65°F) — your body needs to drop its core temperature to initiate sleep.</li>
            <li>Avoid caffeine after noon — its long half-life means it's still disrupting your sleep hours later.</li>
            <li>Morning sunlight exposure helps regulate your circadian rhythm and improves sleep quality at night.</li>
            <li>Alcohol is not a sleep aid — it fragments sleep and blocks crucial REM cycles needed for emotional processing.</li>
        </ol>
