        <h2 class="section-title">📝 Episode Summary</h2>
        <div class="episode-summary">
            <p>In this masterclass episode, Robert Greene sits down with Steven Bartlett to discuss the timeless principles of power, influence, and human nature. Drawing from decades of studying history's most successful leaders, seducers, and strategists, Greene reveals the hidden dynamics that govern every human interaction.</p>
<p>Greene explains that power is not inherently good or evil — it's a neutral force that can be used constructively or destructively. He argues that understanding power dynamics is essential for everyone, not just those who seek positions of authority. Even those who claim to reject power are playing power games whether they realize it or not.</p>
<p>The conversation covers the art of seduction beyond romance — how to captivate attention, build charisma, and create an aura of mystery in professional and personal settings. Greene shares specific strategies from historical figures like Cleopatra, Napoleon, and Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>Steven and Robert also discuss mastery — the process of dedicating yourself to a craft so deeply that you achieve a level of intuitive brilliance. Greene explains why the modern obsession with shortcuts and hacks is the enemy of true expertise, and why the apprenticeship phase of any career is the most important period of your life.</p>
