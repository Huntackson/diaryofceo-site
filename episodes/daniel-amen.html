        <h2 class="section-title">📝 Episode Summary</h2>
        <div class="episode-summary">
            <p>In this alarming and empowering episode, Dr. Daniel Amen shares insights from over 250,000 brain scans to reveal the everyday habits that are silently destroying your brain — and the simple changes that can reverse the damage.</p>
<p>Amen begins with a startling revelation: your brain starts declining at age 25, and most people are accelerating this decline through habits they consider normal. He identifies the top brain-damaging behaviors: poor sleep, processed food, alcohol consumption, lack of exercise, chronic stress, and excessive screen time. Using real brain scan images, he shows the dramatic differences between healthy and unhealthy brains.</p>
<p>The conversation covers Amen's "BRIGHT MINDS" framework — an acronym representing the 11 risk factors for brain health including Blood flow, Retirement/aging, Inflammation, Genetics, Head trauma, Toxins, Mental health, Immunity, Neurohormones, Diabesity, and Sleep. He provides specific interventions for each risk factor.</p>
<p>Steven and Daniel also discuss the surprising link between brain health and mental health, why Amen believes the term "mental illness" is misleading (he prefers "brain health issues"), and how optimizing your brain can improve every aspect of your life from relationships and career performance to emotional well-being and longevity.</p>
