    <h1>Best Money & Investing Advice from Diary of a CEO — Lessons from 12 Millionaires & Billionaires</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Steven Bartlett has sat down with self-made billionaires, Wall Street legends, and unconventional wealth builders. Here's the financial wisdom they all agree on — and the contrarian advice that might surprise you.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The <a href="https://diaryofceo.online">Diary of a CEO</a> isn't a finance podcast — but some of the best money advice on the internet has come from Steven Bartlett's conversations. When you sit down with people who've built real wealth — not crypto bros or Instagram gurus, but people who've created lasting financial freedom — patterns emerge.</p>

    <p>After reviewing every money-related DOAC episode, I've distilled the <strong>best financial advice</strong> into 12 powerful lessons from 12 different guests. Whether you're just starting to think about money or you're looking to level up, these insights are genuinely life-changing.</p>

    <h2 id="money-mindset">💭 Money Mindset — How the Wealthy Actually Think</h2>
    <p>Before tactics and strategies, every wealthy DOAC guest emphasises the same thing: your relationship with money determines your financial outcome more than any investment vehicle ever will.</p>

    <div class="advice-card">
        <h3>1. "Wealth Is What You Don't Spend" — Morgan Housel</h3>
        <p class="guest">Morgan Housel, Author of <em>The Psychology of Money</em></p>
        <div><span class="tag">Psychology</span><span class="tag">Saving</span><span class="tag">Mindset</span></div>
        <p>Morgan Housel's DOAC appearance is a masterclass in financial psychology. His central thesis: wealth isn't about income — it's about the gap between what you earn and what you spend. He shares the story of Ronald Read, a janitor who died with $8 million because he lived below his means and invested consistently for decades, versus high-earning professionals who are broke because they spend everything.</p>
        <blockquote>"Wealth is the nice cars not purchased, the diamonds not bought, the renovations postponed. Wealth is financial assets that haven't yet been converted into the stuff you see."<cite>— Morgan Housel, Author of <em>The Psychology of Money</em></cite></blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Building wealth is more about behaviour than intelligence. The single most powerful wealth-building habit is spending less than you earn — consistently, for decades. It's boring. It works.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="advice-card">
        <h3>2. "Seek Wealth, Not Money or Status" — Naval Ravikant</h3>
        <p class="guest">Naval Ravikant, Angel Investor, Philosopher, Co-founder of AngelList</p>
        <div><span class="tag">Wealth Building</span><span class="tag">Leverage</span><span class="tag">Philosophy</span></div>
        <p>Naval's DOAC episode is one of the most shared financial conversations online. He distinguishes between three things people confuse: money (a tool for exchange), status (your rank in hierarchy), and wealth (assets that earn while you sleep). His framework for building wealth focuses on <strong>leverage</strong> — using code, media, capital, or labour to disconnect your income from your time.</p>
        <blockquote>"You're not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity — a piece of a business, a piece of property, a piece of intellectual property — to gain your financial freedom."<cite>— Naval Ravikant</cite></blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Stop trading time for money as your only income source. Build or acquire assets that generate income without your direct involvement — even if it starts small.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="advice-card">
        <h3>3. "I Will Teach You to Be Rich" — Ramit Sethi</h3>
        <p class="guest">Ramit Sethi, Author of <em>I Will Teach You to Be Rich</em>, Personal Finance Expert</p>
        <div><span class="tag">Personal Finance</span><span class="tag">Automation</span><span class="tag">Rich Life</span></div>
        <p>Ramit Sethi brings a refreshing counter-narrative to the "save every penny" crowd. His core message: stop obsessing over lattes and avocado toast. Instead, negotiate your salary (worth thousands more than cutting small expenses), automate your finances so good behaviour happens without willpower, and spend extravagantly on the things you love while cutting ruthlessly on the things you don't.</p>
        <p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Design your "rich life" first — decide what you actually want money for — then reverse-engineer the finances to make it happen. Automate savings and investments so you never have to rely on discipline.</p>

    <h2 id="investing">📈 Investing — What Actually Works Long-Term</h2>
    <p>When billionaires and financial experts sit on the DOAC sofa, a clear consensus emerges about investing. It's simpler — and more boring — than most people think.</p>

    <div class="advice-card">
        <h3>4. "Time in the Market Beats Timing the Market" — Steven Bartlett</h3>
        <p class="guest">Steven Bartlett, Entrepreneur, Dragon on Dragons' Den</p>
        <div><span class="tag">Investing</span><span class="tag">Index Funds</span><span class="tag">Compound Interest</span></div>
        <p>Steven himself has spoken extensively about investing, both on his podcast and on Dragons' Den. His approach is surprisingly simple for someone worth hundreds of millions: invest consistently in broad index funds, don't try to pick individual stocks, and let compound interest do the heavy lifting. He's shared that he wishes he'd started investing earlier and that the most important factor is simply starting — even with small amounts.</p>
        <p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> If you invested £500/month in a global index fund averaging 8% annual returns, you'd have over £1.4 million after 30 years. The maths is simple. The hard part is patience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="advice-card">
        <h3>5. "Invest in What You Understand" — Guy Raz</h3>
        <p class="guest">Guy Raz, Host of <em>How I Built This</em>, Journalist</p>
        <div><span class="tag">Entrepreneurship</span><span class="tag">Business</span><span class="tag">Risk</span></div>
        <p>Guy Raz's conversation with Steven covers the stories of hundreds of entrepreneurs he's interviewed, and a consistent theme emerges: the people who built the most wealth invested in areas they deeply understood. They didn't chase trends. They spotted opportunities in industries where they had unfair knowledge advantages. Sara Blakely understood undergarments. Howard Schultz understood coffee culture. The best investment you can make is often in your own expertise.</p>
        <p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Before investing in anything — a stock, a business, crypto — ask yourself: "Do I understand this better than 90% of other investors?" If not, stick with index funds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="advice-card">
        <h3>6. "The Power of Compound Interest" — Daniel Priestley</h3>
        <p class="guest">Daniel Priestley, Entrepreneur and Author of <em>Oversubscribed</em></p>
        <div><span class="tag">Compound Growth</span><span class="tag">Business</span><span class="tag">Long-term Thinking</span></div>
        <p>Daniel Priestley's multiple DOAC appearances hammer home one idea: compounding applies to everything — money, skills, relationships, and reputation. He explains that most people overestimate what they can do in a year and underestimate what they can do in a decade. The entrepreneurs who build lasting wealth aren't the ones who make quick money — they're the ones who stay in the game long enough for compounding to work its magic.</p>
        <blockquote>"Most people give up at the exact moment when compounding is about to kick in. They quit after 2-3 years, right before the exponential curve starts."<cite>— Daniel Priestley</cite></blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Whether it's investing or building a business, the first few years feel painfully slow. That's normal. The magic happens in years 5-10+. Don't quit early.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="earning-more">💼 Earning More — Building Wealth from Scratch</h2>
    <p>You can only cut expenses so far. At some point, building real wealth requires earning more. These DOAC guests share how they did it — starting from nothing.</p>

    <div class="advice-card">
        <h3>7. "Build Skills That Stack" — Scott Adams (via Steven Bartlett)</h3>
        <p class="guest">Steven Bartlett, discussing Scott Adams' "talent stack" framework</p>
        <div><span class="tag">Skills</span><span class="tag">Career</span><span class="tag">Income</span></div>
        <p>Steven frequently references the "talent stack" concept: you don't need to be world-class at one thing. Instead, combine 2-3 skills that are rare together. Steven himself combines marketing, public speaking, and technology — he's not the world's best at any single one, but the combination is extremely rare and valuable. This principle applies whether you're employed or building a business.</p>
        <p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Identify 2-3 complementary skills and get in the top 20% of each. The intersection is where outsized earning potential lives. Examples: coding + sales, writing + data analysis, design + psychology.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="advice-card">
        <h3>8. "Your Network Is Your Net Worth" — Alex Hormozi</h3>
        <p class="guest">Alex Hormozi, Entrepreneur, Author of <em>$100M Offers</em></p>
        <div><span class="tag">Business</span><span class="tag">Offers</span><span class="tag">Value Creation</span></div>
        <p>Alex Hormozi's DOAC episode is a tactical goldmine for anyone wanting to make more money. His core framework is simple: find a group of people with a painful problem, create an offer so good they'd feel stupid saying no, and deliver massive value. He breaks down exactly how to price offers (charge based on value delivered, not time spent), how to structure guarantees that eliminate risk for buyers, and why most businesses fail because they have a "good" offer instead of a "grand slam" offer.</p>
        <blockquote>"Make people an offer so good they feel stupid saying no. That's the entire game."<cite>— Alex Hormozi</cite></blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> If you want to earn more, stop thinking about what you want to sell and start thinking about what problems people desperately want solved. Price based on the value of the solution, not the cost of delivery.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="boring-businesses">🏗 Boring Businesses — The Hidden Path to Wealth</h2>

    <div class="advice-card">
        <h3>9. "Buy Boring Businesses" — Codie Sanchez</h3>
        <p class="guest">Codie Sanchez, Investor, Former Wall Street Executive, Founder of Contrarian Thinking</p>
        <div><span class="tag">Boring Businesses</span><span class="tag">Acquisitions</span><span class="tag">Cash Flow</span></div>
        <p>Codie Sanchez's DOAC appearance challenged every assumption about entrepreneurship. While everyone chases tech startups, she invests in laundromats, car washes, vending machine routes, and HVAC companies — "boring" businesses with reliable cash flow and aging owners looking to sell. She explains how to find businesses for sale, how to use seller financing (buying with little to no money down), and why these unglamorous businesses often generate better returns than venture-backed startups.</p>
        <blockquote>"The sexiest businesses are the boring ones. Nobody's competing for a laundromat, which is exactly why the returns are incredible."<cite>— Codie Sanchez</cite></blockquote>
        <p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> You don't need to invent the next app. There are millions of profitable small businesses with retiring owners who need someone to take over. Learn acquisition entrepreneurship — it's lower risk and faster to profitability than starting from scratch.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="advice-card">
        <h3>10. "Cash Flow Is King" — Rob Moore</h3>
        <p class="guest">Rob Moore, Property Investor, Author of <em>Money</em></p>
        <div><span class="tag">Property</span><span class="tag">Cash Flow</span><span class="tag">Passive Income</span></div>
        <p>Rob Moore's DOAC episode focuses on the difference between assets and liabilities — and why most people get it wrong. Your house isn't an asset if it's costing you money every month. An asset is something that puts money in your pocket. He breaks down property investing strategies that generate monthly cash flow, and explains why focusing on cash flow (monthly income) rather than capital gains (hoping prices go up) is the safer, more predictable path to financial freedom.</p>
        <p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Before buying any "investment," ask: does this put money in my pocket every month, or does it take money out? Focus on cash-flowing assets first — they fund your lifestyle and let you sleep at night.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="money-mistakes">⚠️ Money Mistakes — What Every DOAC Guest Warns Against</h2>

    <div class="advice-card">
        <h3>11. "Lifestyle Inflation Will Keep You Broke" — Multiple Guests</h3>
        <p>This warning comes up in almost every money-related DOAC episode. As your income rises, your spending rises to match — new car, bigger house, nicer restaurants. Morgan Housel, Ramit Sethi, and Steven Bartlett himself all emphasise that the people who build lasting wealth are those who resist lifestyle inflation, at least partially. The goal isn't to live like a monk — it's to ensure your savings rate grows faster than your spending.</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>The 50/30/20 rule (adjusted from DOAC advice):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>50% on needs (rent, food, transport)</li>
                <li>30% on wants (entertainment, dining, hobbies)</li>
                <li>20% on savings and investments (minimum — increase as income grows)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="advice-card">
        <h3>12. "Debt Is a Tool — Use It Wisely or It Destroys You" — Steven Bartlett</h3>
        <p class="guest">Steven Bartlett, across multiple episodes</p>
        <div><span class="tag">Debt</span><span class="tag">Risk</span><span class="tag">Financial Literacy</span></div>
        <p>Steven has spoken openly about both good and bad debt. Bad debt (credit cards, consumer loans) charges you interest on depreciating assets — it makes you poorer over time. Good debt (business loans, property mortgages with positive cash flow) uses other people's money to acquire assets that generate returns greater than the interest rate. The key distinction: does the debt make you money, or cost you money?</p>
        <p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Eliminate high-interest consumer debt aggressively. But don't be afraid of strategic debt that funds income-generating assets. The wealthy use debt as a tool — the broke are used by it.</p>

    <h2 id="action-plan">✅ Your Action Plan — Start Today</h2>
    <p>After listening to dozens of millionaires and billionaires on the Diary of a CEO, the consensus is clear. Here's your step-by-step action plan, ordered by impact:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Track your spending for 30 days.</strong> You can't improve what you don't measure. Use an app or a simple spreadsheet. (Ramit Sethi)</li>
        <li><strong>Automate your finances.</strong> Set up automatic transfers to savings and investment accounts on payday. Remove the need for willpower. (Ramit Sethi)</li>
        <li><strong>Open an index fund account and invest consistently.</strong> Even £100/month into a global index fund (like the S&P 500 or FTSE Global All Cap) will compound dramatically over decades. (Morgan Housel, Steven Bartlett)</li>
        <li><strong>Eliminate high-interest debt.</strong> Pay off credit cards and personal loans before investing aggressively. The guaranteed "return" of eliminating 20%+ interest debt beats any investment. (Steven Bartlett)</li>
        <li><strong>Increase your income.</strong> Invest in skills that stack. Ask for a raise. Start a side project. The ceiling on earning is unlimited; the floor on cutting expenses is zero. (Alex Hormozi, Naval Ravikant)</li>
        <li><strong>Build or buy an asset.</strong> Whether it's a business, property, or intellectual property — start acquiring things that generate income without your direct involvement. (Codie Sanchez, Naval Ravikant)</li>
        <li><strong>Play the long game.</strong> The compound curve is brutal for the first 5 years and magical for the next 20. Don't quit early. (Daniel Priestley, Morgan Housel)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="faq">❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>What does Steven Bartlett invest in?</h3>
    <p>Steven has publicly discussed investing in index funds, property, and private companies through his venture fund (Flight Story). He advocates for index fund investing as the simplest approach for most people and has said he wishes he'd started investing earlier.</p>

    <h3>What's the best Diary of a CEO episode about money?</h3>
    <p>Morgan Housel's episode on <em>The Psychology of Money</em> is the most universally applicable — it covers the behavioural side of wealth building that applies to everyone. For tactical business advice, Alex Hormozi's episode is unmatched. For unconventional wealth building, Codie Sanchez on boring businesses.</p>

    <h3>Is the financial advice on DOAC reliable?</h3>
