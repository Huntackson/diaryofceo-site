    <p>The <a href="https://diaryofceo.online">Diary of a CEO</a> has become one of the most trusted sources for health information — not because Steven Bartlett is a doctor, but because he asks the right questions to the right people. From neuroscientists to longevity experts, the guests on this podcast have shared advice that's backed by research and easy to implement.</p>

    <p>After watching every health-focused episode, I've pulled out the <strong>18 most actionable tips</strong> — organized by category so you can start using them today.</p>

    <div class="toc">
        <h3>What's Inside</h3>

            <li><a href="#sleep">Sleep Optimization (Tips 1–5)</a></li>
            <li><a href="#nutrition">Nutrition & Gut Health (Tips 6–10)</a></li>
            <li><a href="#exercise">Exercise & Movement (Tips 11–14)</a></li>

        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2 id="sleep">🌙 Sleep Optimization</h2>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">1</span> Get Morning Sunlight Within 30 Minutes of Waking</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Dr. Andrew Huberman</strong> — In one of the most-watched <a href="https://diaryofceo.online/seo-pages/best-episodes-health.html">health episodes</a>, Huberman explained that viewing bright light (ideally sunlight) within 30 minutes of waking sets your circadian clock, boosts cortisol at the right time, and dramatically improves sleep quality that night. No sunglasses. 5–10 minutes on cloudy days, 2–3 on sunny days.</p>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">2</span> Keep Your Bedroom at 18°C (65°F)</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Matthew Walker</strong> — Your core body temperature needs to drop by about 1°C to initiate sleep. Walker told Steven that a cool room is the single most underrated sleep hack. If you can't control your room temp, try sticking one foot out from under the covers — it acts as a radiator.</p>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">3</span> Stop Eating 3 Hours Before Bed</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Dr. Rangan Chatterjee</strong> — Late-night eating forces your body to digest when it should be repairing. Chatterjee recommended a minimum 3-hour gap between your last meal and sleep. This alone, he said, transforms sleep quality for most people.</p>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">4</span> Use the "Sleep Divorce" If Needed</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Dr. Chatterjee</strong> — Sleeping in separate beds isn't a relationship failure — it's a health decision. If your partner snores or has different sleep schedules, separate sleeping can give both of you dramatically better rest.</p>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">5</span> Avoid Caffeine After 2pm</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Gary Brecka</strong> — Caffeine has a half-life of 5–6 hours. That afternoon coffee at 3pm means half of it is still in your system at 9pm. Brecka was emphatic: if you're having trouble sleeping, cut caffeine after noon and watch what happens within a week.</p>

    <h2 id="nutrition">🥗 Nutrition & Gut Health</h2>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">6</span> Eat 30 Different Plants Per Week</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Dr. Tim Spector</strong> — The diversity of your gut microbiome depends on the diversity of what you eat. Spector's research showed that people eating 30+ different plant types per week had significantly healthier guts. This includes herbs, spices, nuts, seeds — not just vegetables.</p>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">7</span> Add Fermented Foods Daily</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Dr. Tim Spector</strong> — Kimchi, sauerkraut, kefir, yogurt, kombucha. Spector's studies at ZOE found that just 6 servings of fermented foods per week reduced inflammatory markers significantly. Start small — even a tablespoon of sauerkraut with lunch counts.</p>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">8</span> Take Methylated B Vitamins if You Have MTHFR</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Gary Brecka</strong> — Brecka explained that roughly 44% of people have an MTHFR gene variant that prevents proper folate metabolism. A simple genetic test can reveal this. If you have it, methylated B vitamins (methylfolate, methylcobalamin) can be transformative for energy and mood.</p>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">9</span> Front-Load Your Protein</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Dr. Gabrielle Lyon</strong> — Most people eat minimal protein at breakfast and pile it on at dinner. Lyon argued for eating 30–50g of protein at your first meal to trigger muscle protein synthesis early and manage hunger throughout the day.</p>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">10</span> Stop Snacking — Eat Proper Meals</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Dr. Chatterjee</strong> — Constant grazing keeps insulin elevated all day. Chatterjee's advice was simple: eat 2–3 proper meals with enough protein and fat to keep you satisfied, and let your body actually rest between meals.</p>

    <h2 id="exercise">💪 Exercise & Movement</h2>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">11</span> Walk 10,000 Steps — Non-Negotiable</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Multiple guests</strong> — Nearly every health expert on <a href="https://diaryofceo.online">Diary of a CEO</a> has emphasized walking. It's not glamorous, but it reduces all-cause mortality, improves mood, aids digestion, and costs nothing. Steven himself has said walking is the one habit he never skips.</p>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">12</span> Do Cold Exposure 2–3 Times Per Week</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Dr. Andrew Huberman</strong> — Cold showers or ice baths (1–3 minutes at 10°C) trigger a massive dopamine release — up to 2.5x baseline, lasting hours. Huberman stressed doing it <em>before</em> exercise for maximum benefit, not after (cold blunts the inflammatory response needed for muscle growth).</p>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">13</span> Prioritize Resistance Training Over Cardio</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Dr. Gabrielle Lyon</strong> — Lyon's core message: the problem isn't that we're over-fat, it's that we're under-muscled. Muscle is the organ of longevity. Resistance training 3–4 times per week protects against metabolic disease, cognitive decline, and frailty as you age.</p>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">14</span> Move Every 45 Minutes</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Dr. Chatterjee</strong> — Sitting for extended periods is independently harmful — even if you exercise daily. Chatterjee recommended a simple rule: every 45 minutes, stand up and move for 2–3 minutes. A walk to the kitchen. Some stretches. Anything.</p>

    <h2 id="mental">🧠 Mental Health & Stress</h2>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">15</span> Practice the Physiological Sigh for Instant Calm</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Dr. Andrew Huberman</strong> — Double inhale through the nose (two quick breaths in), followed by a long exhale through the mouth. This is the fastest real-time tool for reducing stress, backed by Stanford research. One to three sighs can shift you from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance.</p>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">16</span> Journal for 5 Minutes Daily</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Multiple guests</strong> — Whether it's gratitude journaling (per <a href="https://diaryofceo.online/seo-pages/diary-of-a-ceo-best-business-advice.html">business advice episodes</a>) or expressive writing about stressful events, the research is overwhelming. Huberman cited studies showing 4 days of 15-minute writing sessions improved immune function for months.</p>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">17</span> Get Your Hormone Levels Tested</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Gary Brecka</strong> — Brecka argued that millions of people are walking around with suboptimal testosterone, thyroid, or vitamin D levels and attributing their fatigue to "just getting older." A comprehensive blood panel once a year is one of the highest-ROI health investments you can make.</p>

    <h3><span class="tip-number">18</span> Build a "Stress Threshold" Through Controlled Discomfort</h3>
    <p><strong>Source: Dr. Huberman & Wim Hof</strong> — Cold exposure, hard exercise, and breath work all train your nervous system to handle stress better. The idea isn't to eliminate stress but to expand your capacity for it. Huberman called this "deliberate stress inoculation" — small doses of controlled discomfort that raise your baseline resilience.</p>

    <p>The difference between knowing this and actually doing it? Start with one tip from each category. That's four changes. Give them 30 days. Then come back and add more.</p>
